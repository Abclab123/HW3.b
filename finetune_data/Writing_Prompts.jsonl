What use was a shield when your foes were as slow as a troll , and as intelligent as a goblin ? What use were skills when your foes came at you not with weapons , but broken arms and shattered teeth , which simply scratched at his thick plate armor , leaving bloody streaks that would take hours to clean . A few of the creatures got behind Rafe , and swarmed . Unfazed , Rafe chanted a quick mantra , and a golden light blew the walkers not just back , but fully apart . Disgustingly weak .   These were no lich-risen ghouls . The undead Rafe had spent his life battling were semi-intelligent , and dangerous foes to the uninitiated . These were ... were simply livestock waiting to be slaughtered . None wore battered armor . No rusted sword or mace or axe , somehow utilized with deadly intent . As far as Rafe could tell , the most dangerous weapon these mewling creatures carried were boxes of glass and metal , which shattered at the slightest ill.   Rafe reversed the grip on his hammer , covered in the viscera of countless re-dead . The runic inscriptions that embodied it 's power glowed fiercely , and he swung it mightily . Overkill , as it happens , is n't very heroic . The few undead lucky enough to have direct contact with the head of his weapon simply disintegrated . Behind them , the holy shockwave propagated through the horde , halving the numbers that he faced . Rafe grimaced as the head of one of his victims careened into a small squad of zombies , blowing gaping holes in torsos , amputating limbs , and ultimately causing them to fall into a ceaselessly moaning pile . This is n't the holy war he had fought all his life . There were no heroics , no challenge present in simply destroying the weak . Rafe sighed , and finished off the last of the skeletons with a chain of lightning . Pitiful . Rafe returned to his horse and mounted up . His chestnut horse twitched with anticipation , ready to leave the corpses behind . Rafe grunted , and kicked his mount into a trot .   When the flash of light appeared three nights ago , sending Rafe and his horse away from his companions , Rafe had prepared himself for a noble struggle . The world he appeared in was very different from his own , but staggeringly familiar . Roads that reminded him of old pilgrim 's trails were covered in some sort of cracked black stone , which his horse 's hooves had clacked loudly against , prompting the attack in the first place . He wandered past grand structures that seemed to be lodgings of some kind , although all were thick with signs of loot and decay . Perhaps there might be some bandits to fend off in this forsaken world .   Ahead of Rafe , the road forked . A grass covered red sign spelled out STOP , which Rafe smiled and nodded at . The first time he had encountered such a sign , he had obeyed without question - spending long minutes waiting at the intersection until his horse shook and trotted forward . It was a reminder that this was a different world , even if it shared a similar written language . A sign , Rafe hoped , that any humans he met would be able to communicate with him , and offer knowledge . It had been three days without human contact , only the endless swarm of what Rafe could barely call foes . It was ... unsettling how weak each creature was . If not for their numbers , there would be no threat . Rafe rolled his neck . Perhaps he might find what he was looking for at the next cul-de-sac . He could hear the rising moans , and his horse tensed beneath him . Rafe reached for his sword . It would n't do to get rusty ."}]}

Other than that , the back room seemed pretty normal .   `` I 'm Owen by the way . There are two main questions to this interview , so I 'm not going to even bother with the mundane questions . '' His voice traveled over the clatter of bowling pins . I searched the small area for his whereabouts. `` Question one , what makes you think you 're a good fit for this job ? ''   `` Excuse me ? I did n't realize we were actually being serious here . ''   `` Well , you still showed up . I assume you need a job . Now , defining qualities ... Can you jump buildings in a single bound , shoot laser beams from your eyes ? Cook , maybe ? '' He lifted his head from behind the couch to gauge my reaction .   I did n't satisfy him with one . My response was flat . `` I can deal well with very stressful situations and ignorant people . ''   Owen sat up and opened his mouth again , searching for something to say . He took his time pressing a reset button beside the ball return . `` We 'll just agree you have the uncanny ability to nag people . Question two . ''   Before I could register what was about to happen , he had picked up a tennis ball and chucked it at me . My arms shot out , batting it away just in time . `` What the fuck kind of question was that ? '' I screamed as the ball rolled to a stop at my feet . I wrapped my hand around the balding lime green ball and hurled it back at him .   Owen laughed as the ball bounced off of the wall beside him . `` Jesus we have a lot to train you on . $ 75 an hour starting off . After your 90 days , you 'll make commission . I only pay in cash , under the table . Meet me here Mondays , Wednesdays , and Thursdays . Twelve in the afternoon to let 's say about 9 pm ? Sick and vacation days are to be discussed later . Same with benefits . I need to uh ... 'consult ' HR . ''   The overload of information left me confused . `` Wait , so is this serious ? ''   He picked up a bong off the table beside the tattered couch . The water bubbled inside as he held the flame close to the bowl . When he lifted his head , he exhaled a stream of earthy smoke and stuck it out to me . `` I dunno . I guess we 'll see . ''       Sorry it 's so long . I got bored . haha"}]}

'' David rocked forward in his reclining chair , lazily hoisting himself to his feet and over to Samantha .   `` Alright I 'm here . Wow me . ''   `` It only lasted a few seconds , let me bring it up on the monitor . ''   Samantha tapped some keys and swiped the screen on her desk upwards towards the main monitor . It displayed the signal received on a graph of amplitude versus time . It was a series of complex , seemingly random signals , but started and ended abruptly , lasting only thirteen seconds .   `` What do you think ? ''   `` So ... a random signal started , did its thing , and then stopped a handful of seconds later . You do know that this could be practically anything right ? ''   `` You do n't think it 's odd ? ''   `` I certainly think it 's odd , but it 's definitely not definitive proof of anything . What do you expect me to say ? It looks like noise to me . ''   Samantha sighed . `` You 're probably right . ''   `` Cheer up , tomorrow 's the 40th anniversary of us looking up at the sky and not finding anything . We should be proud . ''   -- -   Samantha went home that night , still thinking about the signal anomaly . Nothing about it screamed E.T. , but the mystery of its source still nagged her all the way on her drive home . She came back to work the next morning , as always . She waved her cellphone across a pad next to the doorway , clocking in for her shift and unlocking the door . David sat in his reclining chair , like always . He took a sip from his coke .   `` Welcome back , Sammy . Any paranormal activity on the home front ? ''   `` No , you ? '' She glared at him , half teasingly .   `` Noope . But hey , you 'll be interested to know that some guy on the night shift received another one of your anomalies last night . ''   `` From the same spot in the sky ? ''   `` Yeah , same spot . Kinda spooky , but , you know ... still just noise . ''   `` Pull it up . ''   `` Yes , mam . '' The signal display appeared on the main screen . `` Anndd , here 's the one you were here for . '' He pulled up the other signal on the screen , displaying both at the same time . `` Exactly the same , down to the last blip . ''   `` And you still think this is n't something ? ''   `` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm not going to go bat-shit crazy about it either . ''   `` What else could it be ? We have a repeating signal , from the same spot in the sky . ''   `` I do n't know . ''   -- -   The signal kept coming back in semi-regular intervals . At first , the intervals were separated by only a few hours , but the separation gradually increased until it was months between each iteration of the signal . After the first couple of iterations , the signal received more attention , quickly gaining the scientific community 's attention . It was n't much long after that they had worked out a formula for when the next iteration would begin . It was growing exponentially . The initial separation was two hours , and the next was two hours and ten minutes , and the third was two hours and thirty minutes . The fourth was five hours and ten minutes . But the signal that lasted for thirteen seconds remained the same .   `` Today 's the big day , just as when we predicted months ago . We should be getting your precious noise again , '' David sipped from a cup of tea at his desk . `` God I 'm glad I stopped drinking that sugary crap . I feel like a god damn Olympian . ''   `` Thanks for sharing your life story , as always , Dave . '' Samantha sat down in front of her monitor . She had a simple program open showing exactly when the next signal should be received .   `` You do n't find it the slightest bit odd that we 're receiving the same signal at exponentially decaying intervals ? I mean , we had to team up with other stations around the world because some of the iterations could only be received on the other side of the planet . ''   `` I find it fucking fascinating . Really , I do . But you wo n't see me jumping for joy when that same old signal comes back for thirteen seconds , and then we wait , what , four months or something ? ''   Several hours passed .   `` Alright , '' said David . `` It 's time for our exponential new years ! '' He yelled enthusiastically . `` Three , two , one ... ! '' He snapped his fingers and pointed to the real-time display where the signal would show up . Nothing happened . Samantha leaned out of her seat .   `` annddd ... GO ! '' he said again . Still , nothing unusual appeared on the feed . `` You sure you did the math right ? ''   `` The formula is n't that complex , '' replied Samantha , `` and we 've been using it for a while . It works down to the second . ''   `` Apparently not any more . ''   `` Yeah , I noticed . ''   Samantha 's mind raced , trying to piece together the puzzle . All they knew about the signal was that the duration of time between iterations was exponentially increasing . Why would it suddenly stop ? The nature of electromagnetic radiation meant that it always traveled at or below c , the speed of light . There were only a couple of obvious answers to why they would not have received the transmission . It 's possible that there might have been an obstruction during the thirteen seconds of the signal 's duration . Perhaps some interstellar gas that had just passed between the Earth and the origin of the signal , or something to that regard . No , the possibilities of anything like that were astronomically , no , infinitesimally small . There had to have been a different reason , but only one thing popped into her mind .   `` Hey , Samantha , you alright ? You seem pretty lost in thought over there . ''   `` I think I might know why the signal did n't show up . ''   `` Please , do tell . ''   `` wherever the signal source was coming from , it must have been travelling faster than the speed of light . ''   David looked at her for a few moments . `` ... you 're serious . ''   `` That 's the only explanation I can think of . ''   `` Well , alright . If that 's true , then we might have to give Einstein a call . And even if it was , we still do n't have any idea what the signal means . Nobody has yet to find any means of deciphering it . ''   `` Somebody has to figure it out eventually . ''   -- -   The year was long before mankind had emerged on the Earth . Long before the dinosaurs . Before the emergence of life . The terrain and atmosphere was inhospitable and acidic . Mars , on the other hand , was flourishing with life . The beings living there had long since made machines to seek out the answers of the universe , as the task was simply too complex , even for humans working together towards a common goal . It was simply impossible to comprehend the sheer complexity of anything beyond what had already been known for hundreds of years . The frontier of technology was entirely in the hands of self-improving AI , and its latest achievement was truly a thing to behold . A space-worthy craft , designed to carry millions of inhabitants towards distant star-systems -- something that had been impossible not too long ago . It took many years to complete construction , and the sheer complexity and scale of the project exhausted what little supplies they had left . The craft floated gracefully in orbit around Mars , with its inhabitants safely on board for its maiden voyage . The on-board computer silently sent the series of commands to commence orbital escape and to set its trajectory to the nearest hospitable planet , somewhere in a solar system millions of light-years away . At some point in the duration of its flight , it sent out a beacon back towards the solar system , repeating every two hours . Due to the nature of interstellar flight and relativistic velocity , the time between intervals increased exponentially , but the message remained the same , encoded quantumly to ensure data retention . The signal was meant for the inhabitants that , unfortunately , had to be left behind on Mars . Encoded in the quantum properties of the electromagnetic radiation , and in a format that would only make sense in a Martian language , there was no use for the future inhabitants of Earth , billions of years later , to try and comprehend it . But to a Martian , the message was simple .   APPROACHING LIGHT SPEED . HOPE STILL ALIVE AND WELL . GOOD BYE ."}]}

I sighed and sat my cup of tea down on my only counter that was not reduced to complete rubble . This was the third time this week but I was rather used to it . I wet a dish rag and knelt down beside the man .   He took the dish rag with an apologetic smile and cleaned the blood off of his face . I had n't seen him around before and his demeanor was quite a bit more refined than the usual super human that came barreling through my house .   `` I 've not seen you around before . Are you a new hero ? ''   `` Um , well not really . '' He sheepishly replied , `` I 've been around for awhile . I just usually do n't come to this part of town . I hear it gets beat up quite a bit . ''   `` My house is the target of many a flying hero . '' I chuckled and stood , `` How far did they throw you this time ? ''   `` From a few miles away . It should take him awhile to get back here . '' The man replied and sat up .   His wounds were healing on his own . I sighed with relief . I had several first aid kits lying around the house for those who did n't have the increased healing ability .   `` You said this house in particular gets hit with flying heroes . '' The man mused , `` Surely you have thought of moving ? It 's far to dangerous for a family to live here . ''   `` Oh , I do n't quite have the money to move . It 's usually spent on repairs to the house . '' I replied , `` I do n't have any a husband or any children . I do n't have to worry about anyone getting hurt but myself . ''   The man seemed surprised . I wondered why as I stood up to grab my cup of tea . After a few seconds he pulled himself out of the floor and stood-no towered- over me .   `` Tea ? '' I offered .   `` I 'm afraid I ca n't right now . ''   I sipped my tea and looked up at him . He seemed to have something on his mind . Probably something to do with the super villain that threw him through my living room wall .   `` So , um , I never got your name ? '' He quietly said .   `` Hmm ? Oh , Annabel . '' I noted his nervous demeanor . `` Annabel O'Leary . ''   `` Well , Miss Annabel . I am very sorry for the mess I have caused . I try to keep my fights away from civilians . After all , they are n't who I 'm concerned with . Well , what I mean to say is , I do n't think I should involve those who are n't in my way . Oh , dear . That did n't come out right at all . ''   `` You 're the villain are n't you ? '' I asked as I finished off what was left of my tea .   He seemed incredibly flustered as he nodded .   `` Figures . '' I chuckled , `` Most of the heroes are quite a bit rude and egotistical . You 're completely different from that . ''   `` Well , Miss Annabel , I am truly sorry to hear that . I hope I 'm not being too bold but um ... .I just could n't help but wonder , would you be interested in going on a date with a super villain ? ''   `` A date ? ''   `` You 're right , it 's a terrible idea . I mean , I 'm trying to take over the world and you 're a civilian . ''   `` No , I am rather fond of the idea . ''   A voice calling the name of the villain boomed from outside . I sighed as our conversation was being cut short .   `` I 'll be back later tonight when I 'm not beating this hero to a pulp . '' The villain flashed a charming smile and started to leave .   `` Wait ! '' I called , `` Who is it out there ? ''   `` Ah , I believe it is Captain Hammer . ''   `` Oh God . Please smash his face for me . He 's probably the hero I loathe the most . After he got drunk and pissed on my Azaleas for the sixteenth time I lost all respect for him . ''   `` With , pleasure Miss Annabel . ''   I watched the super villain dart out of the hole in the wall and launch himself into the sky . I peered from my wrecked living room and silently rooted for the bad guy ."}]}

I intern at a research company in Manhattan . Most of the time I 'm shadowing scientists comparing animal DNA to human DNA , isolating the genes responsible for cellular growth and regrowth . It 's pretty cool stuff , except for the getting up at 5 AM part .   I got in the car and cranked up the tunes . Not too high though ; I have sensitive hearing . As I neared the Queensborough bridge I felt a tingle run up my spine . It wrapped around my head and rattled my brain . Normally I can localize this . I know where the feeling is coming from . This time it was everywhere . I felt myself loose focus .   `` BEEEEEEEEEEEP ! '' blared a car on the right lane . I snapped back into the moment and swerved right . My heart raced . I started to feel it come back . I felt it in my teeth , in my eye sockets . I stopped trying to block it out .   `` Concentrate . '' I thought . `` Isolate it . Label it . '' There was no fighting it . I had to accept it .   `` WHOOSHHHH ! '' roared a jet overhead . I had it . I looked up , trying to identify what kind of jet it was .   `` HONK ! ! ! '' blared another car . I swerved to the left .   The jet slowed down . It came to a full stop and hovered above the bridge .   `` That 's weird . ''   `` REEEEEEEEEEEEEE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' came a shriek . It pierced through my ears like a pair of knives . I started having tunnel vision . Every muscle in my body clenched , and I felt my body being tugged to the right . The front of my car nudged the back of the car in front of me . We both swerved and skidded . I felt the airbags in my car encase me . Four jolts later I was still . A symphony of car horns honked , muffled by the airbags .   The shriek stopped . My senses slowly went back to normal . I fought my through the airbags and eventually climbed out of the car . I had just caused a massive pileup just before the bridge . In the distance , I could faintly see the last car on our side of the road exit the bridge . The jet hovered above .   Suddenly the bridge creaked . The sound of metal twisting was unbearable . Cables began snapping and the bridge swayed as if a giant hand was rocking it back and fourth . It bent upwards and came crashing down , tearing in half . Cars tumbled into the water . As horrified as I was , I could n't ignore the fact that my accident had prevented all of the cars involved from being on the bridge .   I crawled back into my car . Most of the airbags were still inflated , providing me with enough cover . I awkwardly changed in the backseat . Another jet came overhead , but it was n't preceded by a tingle . These were friends . The jet was flying low . I climbed up the parts of the bridge that had n't been destroyed yet and waited for the right moment . This could either rip my arm out of its socket or look really super awesome . The jet got closer and closer . Just at the moment I felt was right I leaped off the bridge I reached out with my right arm and squeezed .   A perfect string of web shot out of my wrist and latched onto the jet .

''   I put the phone down slowly as I thought about what this would mean . I have lived my entire life watching people fall hopelessly in love . I 've seen so many find the one they were meant to be with and spend the rest of their lives together . Some find the person exactly when they are meant to find them and life gets even more perfect for both . Others find each other and you can see the connection , but life can get in the way of that . I see these events and know that with just a little push they can make it work .   That 's where I come in . I do n't how it happened . I just know one day that it did . I remember being in high school my senior year . Two of my best friends who always had a thing for each other were sitting at lunch together . I joined them as I had everyday since freshman year . I remember us all laughing and talking about college with wild ambition . We discussed the great careers we would have and the houses we would build after becoming successful adults . We were always together and knew we would grow old together , but I knew that they were meant to grow old together . I wish I had that type of connection with someone .   Many of our friends pushed them to date , but they always shied away from it . I do n't know if it was just their virgin hearts but something was keeping them apart . But everyone could see it . They had the connection that every human longs for and believes it impossible to find . Even romantics know that a connection that deep is a fairy tale to most . People do n't just fall in love and have everything fall into place as it should . In this day and age when two people meet , even if it is a real connection , they have to fight from the start to make it work .   My phones vibration startles me and brings me back to my car .   `` Hey , where are you ? We need to meet ... .Listen , I know what you told me . We went through it all before . I 've made my decision . Just meet me at the address of the hospital I gave you . ''   I throw the phone down in the seat next to me . I know what will happen if I choose to go through with it . I told him that I did n't care , and that if it was the only way then what choice did I have left . He was like me . One day it just happened . He was at the hospital visiting a friend who was in a coma after a serious accident . He wanted more than anything to have his friend back and to be able to see him smile again . He begged the doctor to do something and the doctor said there was nothing left to do . He was holding his friends hand and when he grabbed the doctor 's arm to plead him to do more , it happened .   The doctor fell to the ground and his friend opened his eyes . The doctor now lays in that same hospital bed and in a coma ever since . He 's been in hiding ever since . His friend went on to be a successful surgeon and the mystery of that day was never explained . My two friends in high school ended up dating after that lunch we had . I joking placed my hands on both of their heads and pushed them together telling them just how perfect they looked together . They were inseparable after that and I found out they are married with two kids now and have spent their lives together as the happiest couple you could ever meet . We grew apart once I knew .   It was n't until years later I figured out what happened . It was when I touched them that the connection was made . It could n't be broken . I tried it on others . Every couple that I placed my hands on or even two strangers immediately fell for each other and never fell out of love . I tried touching my head and a girl 's that I got along with and found attractive but nothing happened . I have never been the object of anyone 's affection . We could be completely compatible but still nothing would ever work out .   He said when he figured out what happened to him that he tried to use it on himself . He was too afraid to touch anyone else and ruin anyone else 's life that he just wanted to make it stop . If he had to switch with someone else that did n't have a life then he would do it to give them another chance . But it would n't work on himself . I figured that it was the same for me . I can make others fall in love but I ca n't .   I found out that my best friend from high school was in the hospital . He had been severely injured at work and was in the hospital . My other best friend who loved him more than anything in the world had stayed by his side and promised to never give up . I do n't care if I do n't remember who I am or that she wo n't know it 's me . It might be my only chance to ever be loved .   But what if my power stays with me ..."}]}

Today , you turned 70 .\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In high school I knew a pair of twins , brother and sister , who loved messing with people 's heads . They were both class clowns , seemingly as a unit , and basked in the glory of countless pranks throughout their high school careers .  I remember on national bacon day they decided , having come from a rural area in Iowa , to release 3 greased pigs in the hallways of our school , poetically labeled 1 , 2 , and 4 . The school staff managed to usher the pigs into a single hallway and gathered all willing teachers to do their best to corral these slippery swine . Eventually the 3 hogs were confined to a single classroom ( the art room , which took months to completely clean , by the way ) . The principal then ordered the entire school to track down pig number 3 . The rest of the day was spent by all , literally tracking a ghost pig .  Anyway , I had lost contact with these twins after high school , but every so often I would see their high jinks on Facebook . I knew they 'd be planning something big and I had to be a part of their goodbye ceremony .  So the day finally arrives , and they tell everyone that they will be performing their goodbye `` show '' , as they called it , in front of the high school where so many of their pranks had originated .  I figure this is a good time to mention that each of the twins had their own set of twins , who , now , were obviously grown .  Now , I had been to my share of these events and the children are always a bit thrown by the experience , but when I arrived to see the twins ' children smiling and laughing I thought it a bit strange .  I shook it off and awaited the much anticipated arrival of the twins .  10 minutes went by and they had not yet shown .  20 minutes .  30 minutes .  Everyone was growing impatient .  But just as the murmuring and grumbling started to pick up , the twins walked out of the front of the building , completely naked ( remember they 're 70 ) , greased up just like those pigs from high school , wearing only the numbers 1 and 3 on their backs .  As soon as they made their presence known , they immediately turned around and sprinted through the doors into the school , splitting off into different directions , inviting us all to chase them and wrestle their naked bodies along the slippery linoleum floors .  Their children were the first in , but instead of chasing them down , they too stripped off their clothes and exposed the numbers 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 on their bare asses as they sprinted off into the dimly lit hallways .  We all stood , shocked , not knowing what to do next . But as we 've seen with so many things , as one goes , we all go .  Eventually we all excitedly rushed our ways into the school ready to wrestle these greasy bastards to the ground for their last hurrah . Everyone had the time of their lives trying to wrangle those wrinkly bodies into submission , and the twins laughed joyously the entire time , just like back in high school .  Of course , we can not forget the purpose of this sly trick . So when the fun and games were over , the high school , out for holiday break , had two greasy old bodies lying comically on their floors , labeled with the numbers 1 and 3 .  Rumor has it the staff had walls torn down looking for that elusive number 2 ."}]}

My mind raced back to that fateful week in high school . Anne . She was perfect to me . French , brunette and an amazing smile . She laughed at my jokes even when I did n't try .

I wanted so much .   The night of homecoming was a disaster . I waited in a line of 200 people with five *friends* I barely knew . The closest of the five , Jon , had seen Anne walk right behind me .

I must have been lost in my own thoughts again . I opened my mouth to speak and he was a step ahead of me . He knew the question . What happened ?   `` The night of homecoming , our paths split into two . You walked around for hours waiting for the dance to end . Did n't even try to dance .

You remember how light footed she could be ? She came closer and told me Jon had explained everything to her . I looked at her and apologized . I told her I was sorry I took the blame for something I didnt do . She forgave me and we danced the night away . I got the kiss I wanted and we were happy for quite some time .

My Alex tells me he 's coming to visit you ; that your close to dying . I dont know how I should feel . I dont know what you grew up to be , but I hope you did n't keep everything pent up forever . The reason you and I happened is an interesting one ; Jon saw you starting to dance and pulled me in to look . After you finished he explained everything to me , how you were completely oblivious to what Andrew told me . I had no clue up to that point . I wanted to give you another chance . But only because you were able to let go of the bottled up emotions . I hope you grew up to be what my Alex did .

I do n't really think of it as fraud , I 'm not doing aanything wrong other than blaming the other person . It 's human nature . Anyways , I continued to do this about once a month . I actually used it to trade up from that first piece of crap 1990 Accord to this baby , my brand new McLaren 675LT . After that first accident I bought a 2003 BMW 3 Series . I was driving that one home maybe a little faster than I should have when I ran a red light and got hit by aanother car . I promise this one was an accident as well . I got out of the car and yelled at the man and he too accepted responsibility and left before any law enforcement could show up . at that point I began to scheme . Now with the $ 14,000 from insurance I bought a Kia Optima , actually a rather nice car , and with the leftover $ 500 I went out and bought a nice suit , bluetooth earpiece and briefcase to make myself look important . Luckily I looked old for my age or this maybe would n't have worked so well . Now I sat and waited in the parking lot for the perfect car . I had spotted it , A nice crossover with ski racks on top . I maade my move and pulled in front of it then slammed on the brakes and he rearended me . I got out of the car acting angry and dazed . Thats when I noticed him . A big dude , more tatoos than bare skin , a bandana on his head and a Smith & Wesson shirt . I really screwed this one up . He began to yell until he looked at me and went silent . Then he sheepishly asked , `` Wait , are you a lawyer ? '' Nerviously I told him I was , to which he began to profusely apologize , we traded insurance and we were on our way .

I began to get in more accidents , my goal of a million dollar mansion getting closer . It was finally time for my last crash . I was only $ 120,000 short of my mansion . One more crash and I would have enough for the house , the car and even enough left over to put in a pool . I spotted my target , a relatively new minivan with a youth soccer sticker on the back . The perfect victim . I pulled in front of her and slammed on the brakes as I did many times before but she managed to swerve around me and she even began to speed up . No problem , I 'm in a Lambo , she ca n't out run me in that piece of crap . I tried to swerve in front of her but she reacted fast enough to get out of the way and began to speed up even more . At this point we both knew what was happening and it was the most ridiculous street race ever , a Lamborghini versus a soccer mom 's minivan and the minivan was winning ... as she pulled ahead she turned in to a parking lot and dropped a few kids off . One of them was even carrying an undisturbed tray of orange slices . In anger I simply rammed the parked van not thinking how I would get out of this one . It went to court and while I avoided any criminal charges , I was forced to pay to replace the car and also pay out for `` emotional trauma '' that the mom claimed the kids were suffering from . As we walked out of the courtroom she brusshed past me to say , `` Never get in the way of Susan when she 's trying to get the kids to soccer practice on time . '' I was baffled . With what money was left , I settled for a McLaren and a 4 bedroom 3 bath house with a pool . I still want that Lamborghini back some day .

See the wear around the wheel base- '' ( I pointed to the area I meant ) `` -it got that in its very first military engagement !

He looked in his late-30 's , perhaps 40 's if he takes care of himself . He was n't a big man , but in his long-sleeve shirt I could see he had the silhouette of a man that does n't think exercise a hobby , more as a way of life .

I asked him what it signified .   `` Oh that 's nothing , we have colours that relate to ones ' seniority within management , my own colour represents 5-A , it goes all the way up to 8-A , though you do n't see very many of those in here .   `` Oh ...

Are n't the employees taught to recognize you on-sight ? ''   `` We have shifts . ''   ... I waited for an explanation until the man stopped at what would have been an unremarkable door , had it not possessed a particularly strange-looking door-handle . He looked behind himself before adding .   `` -very strict security in this particular part of the building , could you please avert your gaze ? We do n't usually let clients in this area unless they specifically ask . ''   `` Certainly . ''   I averted my gaze before I heard the door open and asked - `` Can I look now ?

But as it turned out , she fancied me , too . And she wanted to spend some alone time with me as well . Who would have guessed ?   Needless to say , I was as happy as a clam .

That 's fine with me . What matters is that she 's here with me .   *The fire is slowly dying and my dear is still goodbyeing*   Well , dinner is finally ready . I should go see if she is ready now . When I went into the bedroom to check on her , I saw that she was laying in bed just as I had left her .   Goodness , I hope she is n't the lazy type . After all , idleness is the Devil 's workshop .   I carried her downstairs to the living room .   `` Christine , you 're heavier than you look . Oh come now , I 'm not calling you fat . Not at all . I think you 're the most beautiful woman in the world . I 'm just commenting that you 're heavier than you look ... I 'm not doing myself any favors , am I ? I 'm sorry , let 's just eat .

''   While eating , I noticed that she was n't eating .   `` Is the food not to your liking , Christine ? ''   She said nothing .   `` Oh come now , Christine . That 's not very polite to not say anything . I slaved all day to make this dinner . ''   She remained silent .   I decided not to pursue the matter . Why ruin things ? I finished my dinner and drained my glass of wine .   `` If you 're not going to eat , perhaps then you 'll dance with me .

But if you 'll really hold me tight all the way home I 'll be warm*   I grabbed her from her seat and danced with her to the song .   `` I thought you said that you majored in dance while you were in college , Christine .

They looked like they were scratched out . Mother of God .   `` Are you alright ? Do you want me to call someone ? ''   `` Wake up , Finn . ''   `` What does that mean ? ''   `` You ca n't sleep forever , '' She grinned . `` It was Jack . Jack did it . '' And with that , she disappeared . I saw her reflection in the mirrors . She started to spell out something . It was written in red ; blood . It said : 'Jack did it . '   What does that mean ?   The room spun again and I soon found myself falling to the ground .   ~~~   I woke up , a sweat running down my forehead .   `` You alright , mate ?

Over pronounced gasps swept the subway train as others took note of this excellent news . The woman who had spoken behind him was joined by a jovial fellow wearing a fedora . A great smile was on this man ' s face and he was staring at Liam as though Liam ' s face were cast with gold . \" Well let me see that there song my good man ! \" the man who must be jack exclaimed while reaching out physically towards Liam ' s notebook . Liam turned his body and slipped the notebook into his coat to block Jacks overreaching arm from taking it . Immediate bewilderment etched itself on Jack ' s face as he was turned down .   \" Well honey , it looks like this man needs to be cheered up . Why , he is so miserable , that he won ' t even share his gift of music with the rest of us in this cabin. \" Jack told his significant other .  \" The gift of music has such miraculous power to heal the soul though Jack , why doesn ' t he want to share ? \" The girl asked as though heart broken .   \" Why maybe he doesn ' t have a mother. \" Someone chirped up from a few rows back .   \" Let ' s cheer him up ! \" two people cried out simultaneously .   Liam groaned as music began playing from nowhere in particular . Jack began singing in a beautiful tenor voice , and in moments the entire subway car had joined him except Liam . The song was all about how music makes the world go round , and about how one can always confide in the friend known as music . Liam produced a flask from within his coat and cursed himself for not taking a cab to work today . Every few seconds one of the singers , who were all dancing at this point , would attempt to take Liam by the hand to make him join into the activities .   Liam had only managed to keep his sanity by staying perpetually drunk . As early as he could remember everyone in this world would break into dance and song at the drop of a hat . To make matters worse , every individual always knew not only the lyrics of the song , but also the dance routines . He had once boldly asked a teacher how everyone knew the song and dance and was met with a silly look followed by a song entitled \" Music wells up from within \" . The worst part was that Liam himself had a deep driving desire to write music . If he didn ' t he seemed to go mad . He had once showed his songs and lyrics to others , but he was scolded for his work . It was too depressing they told him . No one would ever want to dance to that , they said .   \" Next stop , 45th and main \" the speakers called out , in a rhythm which just happened to the beat of the song . As the subway doors opened , Liam quickly attempted to make his way through the crowd who began to serenade him as he walked . Liam shot through the subway doors at the last moment and sighed in relief as the sound of the song faded with the departure of the subway .   Picking himself up off the ground he prepared himself mentally for the gauntlet he would face walking from here to work when he heard , \" Hey did you see how that guy almost didn ' t make it off the subway in time ? \" Liam screamed and began to run as he heard music begin again while another voice stated \" Lets sing about that ! \""}]}

Then we had Allison , unassuming and homeless , and looking back , had probably killed someone before . Just a hunch . Also , not a person to gamble with , unless you were n't attached to your money . I think she just wanted to fight something . Or maybe she was serious about it , you could never tell with her .   I could never define Hansen . He was shifty . I do n't even think Hansen was his name . What I did know was that his parents actually had money , which was useful . They ran a store in town . Do n't think they cared much for their kid .   Gill was a quebecois who moved to the neighborhood a few years back , shuffled between foster homes and shit . I suppose he wanted a home he could call his own , or maybe he was just done with life . I do n't know what any of us wanted   -- -- -- -- -- -- -   The plan was we called the police to the boathouse after hours , use homemade flamethrowers to ... .   Take their weapons and other useful gear , steal a boat and hideout in the woods for a few days while we figured out our next move . Hansen was going to stay in town and smuggle us food .   This was the first step of our glorious revolution . Murder some police and steal their shit . We did n't realize it at the time , but we were the villains .   And our loss was inevitable .   -- -- -- -- -   The call went out , and Hansen said goodbye . If everything went well , he 'd come and leave supplies out in the forest at a few predetermined locations . Nothing went well , and I do n't know what happened to Hansen .   We waited about 35 minutes . Our town was remote , the nearest police station was miles away . A small S.W.A.T team went in to the boathouse . The door went down , the first man entered the building . And the flamethrower went off .   I will never forget the screaming .   Al did n't stop the flamethrower , and ran out of fuel soon after . She pulled the corpse to the side , while more police ran in , and Jack started her flamethrower up .   Al tossed me a pistol , while she checked the policeman 's shotgun for ammo . I heard something I think might have been a gunshot . I turned back to the door . There were three corpses in the doorway . Two cops and Jack .   I do n't know what killed her , but Gil got a better look and said her flamethrower blew up in her face . There was only one cop left , and Al managed to kill her pretty quickly . I think . I did n't see . I was looking at my friends face . It was still .   And I knew I 'd killed her . Not technically , but this was my idea . This was my fault .   I almost threw myself out the door with hands up , but the police were all dead . My `` Plan '' had taken 5 lives , for what .   Thomson and Al pulled me into the boat . Gil was n't moving either . I think he was going through the same thing I was . I never did get a chance to ask . Once Al had got Gil into the boat , Thomson kicked the boat into gear .   We got about a mile out into the lake before Gil spoke up `` What have we done Wash ? '' . I sunk back into my seat . I did n't know . Technically we won . We got the guns , we got their gear . Most of us lived . But it was a hollow victory .   Nothing I could think of could justify what we had done . I think Gil felt the same . He got out of his seat , and jumped off the boat . We lost him in the dark water of the lake . We would have turned back to check , but saw police lights in the night . We could n't stop now .   We hid the boat , took shelter in a cave . I do n't remember what else happened that night . We did n't get caught .  We probably did n't get caught because we were off the grid . We could n't see any landmarks , could n't see the town .   We woke up and things somehow got worse than they already were . Snowstorm . Boat disabled , likely permanently . When I woke up , Al and Thomson were sitting in the cave , silently .  I do n't know what happens now . It just wo n't be good .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Wash , Thomson and Allison were later declared dead by police , and two bodies were recovered , but not identified .   Hansen went missing shortly afterwards , with no known reason .   The case was given extensive media coverage for several weeks , but interest waned , and the case was never closed .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --"}]}

When you turn 18 , you discover you are the first level 1 wizard in over 1000 years .\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\" It was rigged ; it has to be rigged this year. \"   This was what all of my friends were saying about the standardized career acquisition test ( SCAT ) . The law of the land was that when you turned 18 , you were given a strict personality test that would determine what you would do for the rest of your life . Whatever job you were given , you would start as a level 1 novice , then work your way up through apprentice , journeyman , adept , expert , and then finally level 100 master . People were usually trained by a master until they reached journeyman rank , at which point they would strike out on their own to perfect the craft of their profession .   I was the youngest of the group of my friends by a few months , so I was the last of them to take the SCAT that year . It first started with Thomas , who became a freight worker for the local train yard . We got a good laugh at it , and gave him some playful jabs about Thomas the Tank Engine . He took it in stride , but didn ' t really appreciate it either .   Next came Joe , who among us was known as \" the collector \" . Joe was known as a dumpster diver who was always looking for discarded treasure and would sell his treasures to get an income . Joe became a novice garbage collector as the result of his SCAT results .   Robin became a postal worker , Justin was called to be a worker at the local coal mine , and Michael became a novice fast food server .   Thomas was the oldest , and was often the first to speak his mind . \" We all got crappy jobs ! We are all NPC 's ! It has to be rigged this year to help bring balance back to the work force ! \"   Robin tended to be more level headed about the situation . \" Thomas , you are good a keeping inventory , it makes since that you are a freight worker down at the train yard\u2026 No matter how ironic it may be . Besides we can ' t say that it is rigged with total certainty yet . There is still one of us yet to take the SCAT. \"   I knew what I had to say at this point as everyone was wanting to know what I thought of since I still need to take the test .   \" If you are right , and it is rigged , then no matter how I answer my test I will end up with a crappy job for the rest of my life . Since it is multiple choice , I ' m just going to answer with the letter C on every question . I have got to do better than a fast food worker. \"   Robin shook her head . \" You ' re an idiot , but you have a point , you can ' t do much worse the Michael. \"   After some jokes of the profession I would deserve with this kind of stunt , we all parted ways and went home .   The following day , I walked to the testing area . The room had about 20 other people in it , all ready to take the SCAT today . There was a banner across the room saying happy birthday , but it looked like it had been hanging in the room for years .   The proctor came in and handed us our tests , and sat in the front of the room . \" Alright everyone , I know that you have all been preparing for this moment , but I need to stress how important this test is . This will determine the rest of your lives , so please , read everything carefully . There are no correct answers , just answer them how you best see fit . The test should take you about 3 hours , so go ahead and begin . Good luck all. \"   I sat for a few minutes , trying to decide if I really wanted to carry out my plan . What if I get something absolutely horrible by doing this ? I could become a lumberjack , get hit by a falling tree and not even make it to 20 years old , but if I try , maybe I could become a high ranking political figure\u2026 I sat and wasted about 5 minutes going back and forth in my head .   \" Screw it ! \" I yelled and Everyone turned to look at me . \" S-Sorry , apparently that was my out loud voice\u2026 \" I sank back into my chair and started filling in the C bubble for every question . I felt that life was a crock at this point since this one test was the determining factor for my entire life . If worse came to worse I would become a bum and live off the land .   I finished my test in about 15 minutes , walked up to the proctor , and handed him my test . The proctor looked at me . \" Are you sure about this young man ? You can ' t retake it , this decision of yours is a lifelong consequence. \"   \" I ' m sure , where do I go to find my test results ? \"   \" Walk through those doors there and wait in the room , your results will come up in a few minutes and then you will be escorted to the proper place. \"  I sat in the waiting room for what felt like an eternity . This was a life sentence that I was waiting for . What had I done ? This was a horrible decision .  The screen flashed on the wall . I didn ' t want to look at what my stupidity had brought upon me , but I mustered the courage to look up , and see the screen flash \" wizard. \"   \" \u2026 What the\u2026 ? What does that even mean ? \" The door slid open on the other side of the room , and an elderly looking man dressed in flowing robes was standing there .   \" I have been waiting for someone like you young man\u2026 . Waiting for about 1000 years or so . No one has been daring or stupid enough to mark all C ' s on a test , I will let you decide if you were daring or stupid . I am the only wizard left .

That had made it feel better . Daddy had gotten a little angry at him when he 'd cried , but Mommy had been there to hug him .   Mommy always told him that big boys were n't afraid of the dark , but Tim still felt afraid now . There was something under his bed . Something big , dark , and scary . He could feel it .

Hey , want to hear a joke ? Maybe we can distract you from being hungry . ''   `` Sure ! I love jokes ! ''   `` Why did the chicken cross the road ? '' the voice asked .   `` Hmm . I dunno !

Tim slumped back . `` All of this ... was it real ? ''   He felt the smile one last time .   `` Does it matter ? ''"}]}

I did n't have a computer at the time , so I tried taking notes in class with my left hand , a hand whose only purpose until that point had been to hold Kleenex when my right hand was occupied .   It started off innocently enough . Like the stellar student I was n't , I spent the entire class trying to doodle with left-handed ineptitude . Suddenly , without warning or sound , the deformed 'Superman S ' I was drawing leapt off my notebook , made a high pitched squeal and jumped through the class window , shattering it . The entire class ran to the window as the 'S ' flew off to the sky , staggering back and forth as though it were drunk . People would have asked if it was a bird or a plane , but it looked more like a childhood kite that got eternally damaged in a garage flood .   At first I did n't understand what had happened . It took a few more of these incidences for me to realize this power I was wielding . First , a small house with a 'X ' on the door appeared in the corner of the classroom . It was so misshapen , it immediately fell over and crushed Mrs. Spinningsworth ankle . Then , a smiley face fell from the ceiling , with edges so badly rounded it looked as though it had 2-dimensional leprosy . Luckily I did n't draw it with an open mouth\u2013\u2013it conveyed pain enough with it 's one open ( and terribly crossed ) eye .   I tried to harness this divine power to my advantage , drawing detailed hamburgers with colour instead of just pencil . It worked in that it actually produced real food ; it failed , however , in that my left-handed inability produced what looked like a satanic version of a lunch-lady sloppy joe .   At first this power to create through drawing drew wide public attention . It was only after everyone realized how completely useless this left-handed ability was in the hands of a right-hander that they scoffed and found more interesting things to care about , like cats wearing sweater vests .   It 's been a few months since I first discovered the power , and I must say , I 'm improving . I effectively drew a stick-figure with a full face of features who I 'm able to converse with . Unfortunately , I also had to draw chains to shackle him to my basement cellar so he would n't go on the murderous , revengeful rampage against humanity he seemed hellbent on fulfilling . Apparently , he felt that humans had exploited his stick-figure kind , hanging them over and over again from an inability to guess movie titles .   One day , I might be able to draw things I 'll actually be able to enjoy , like food or drink . Until then , this decrepit sloppy joe will do just fine ."}]}

''   `` Of course , sir ; I have them right here . ''   As the Commander accepted the papers from his colleague , he took one last look out of his office window at the screaming populace below . As much as he enjoyed watching the people go about their daily lives , they were much more enjoyable to watch before they were on fire . Several times in the past , he had successfully defended and protected these people from various adversities , and had received numerous commendation for doing so . This time would prove to be the exception and , predictably , would also be his last .   `` Martha , '' noted the Commander as he perused through the pages . `` I 'm looking over these charts , and I 'm afraid I do n't see where the problem is . The orbital atmospheric scrubbers appear to be working perfectly as intended . ''   `` Well , sir , that 's just the problem . When the scrubbers were launched they were intended to mitigate climate change by converting greenhouse gasses into oxygen . Today , they still perform this job with the utmost efficiency . ''   Martha paused to compose herself before continuing . `` Unfortunately , the R & D team failed to properly factor in the human response to this project . ''   `` What exactly do you mean , Martha ? '' the Commander asked , the fear and annoyance in his tone becoming more prominent . `` How could 'human response ' cause such a disaster of unparalleled scale ? ! ''   Martha attempted to explain as best she could , given her circumstances : `` Even though the scrubbers greatly reduced global temperature increases caused by climate change , heavy industries saw this as an excuse to increase their production , and thus their pollution , rather than working on ways to reduce the pollution their industries cause . This year , greenhouse gas emission levels were even higher than they were when the scrubbers were launched . The gasses are being converted by the scrubbers , and ironically , this means that oxygen levels in our atmosphere are now dangerously high . ''   Taking note of the sight outside the Commander ' s window , she ended her exposition with a slight quip : `` I think by now you 've probably figured out how flammable pure oxygen is . ''   `` I 'm not interested in your jokes , Martha , I 'm interested in knowing if there 's any way we can stop this ! '' the Commander bluntly insisted .   `` The scrubbers are positioned over several key population centers in geosynchronous orbit , and each one is powered by a self-sustaining onboard nuclear reactor designed to last at least a century . Even if we could somehow launch a rocket into orbit with enough people knowledgeable enough to disconnect the power source , they 'd still have to do it at least 49 more times before oxygen levels drop below 'Oh , the humanity ! ' amounts . Furthermore , by the R & D team ' s calculations , the scrubbers would need to be deactivated within about\u2026 10 minutes or so. \"   After Martha finished , the Commander ' s look went from anxious trepidation to a kind of sobering tranquility . He finally understood the reason for Martha ' s humor . Speaking softly , the Commander asked : \" I suppose it would be a stretch to ask the R & D department to rerun the numbers ? \"   \" Normally I would honor your request , sir . However , based on my knowledge of the protection the R & D facilities have , the rest of the team have probably been reduced to pure carbon by now. \"   The Commander chuckled slightly at Martha ' s last statement as he glanced out his window at the scenery unfolding around them . There was an odd , nihilistic sense of beauty to the cataclysm his people had wrought that was now consuming everything they had ever achieved . For the first and last time of his life , he was truly at peace .   \" Martha , I have one last request for you , if you would be so kind as to honor it. \"   \" What is it , sir ? \"   \" Please go down to my quarters and retrieve my music player .

Or was it a signal for something worse ?   They did n't have long to wait to find out .   The beasts leapt at them without warning .

The group scattered , running in all directions but with no plan , no idea of where to go . The screaming began in earnest now , an outpouring of sheer terror at the prospect of being devoured whole . David added his own voice to the cacophony .   `` Mike ! Mike ! MIKE ! Stay with me .

The beasts bounded into the group , bowling them over , sending them skittering and occasionally picking off anyone too slow to get out of the way . David followed Mike as he barreled towards the edge of the arena before turning and rushing back towards the center .   Mike had lost it . `` What are you doing ? We 're gon na die down there , '' David wailed . The words were lost on Mike who charged on heedlessly as one of the beasts took David in the side knocking him down and sending him rolling across the floor . He cried out , more in shock than actual pain , fully expecting to be torn in half and disbelieving that he was still alive .   `` Shit ! Mike ? Mike where the fuck are you ? ''   Keep moving . He had to keep moving . If he stood still , he was a dead man . As if to punctuate the point he caught sight of a woman in front of him . She stood in one spot , turning in a circle as if not sure of which way to go . Was any way better than any other , David wondered . One of the beasts collided with her , knocking her off her feet and straight into the jaws of a second . All it took was one moment and she was gone .   Several more people sprinted across his vision , screaming as they went . Where was he ? Where ?   Across the arena he caught sight of Mike , still running aimlessly , tirelessly . Get to Mike . Get to him . And then what ? It was a shit plan , but it was his only plan . If he was going to die here he was going to do it with someone he knew . A small comfort , but the only thing his panicked mind could come up with .   A blow to his back send him careening forwards . By luck , it pushed him straight into Mike 's arms , bringing him to a stop . They babbled at each other , knowing they were n't making sense and that the other was n't listening .   `` Mike , we got ta ... Dave , the hell man ... What if we ... I ca n't do this ... ''   It was cut short in a flash as one of the beasts caught Mike by the back of his shirt , flipping him up into the air briefly . He landed heavily , the wind knocked out of him and unable to regain his feet . With no respite the beast that had tossed him scoffed him down .   A quick glance around told David he was the last survivor . Did this mean he 'd won ? Would they call off the beasts and release him ? Even now , their assault was relentless . He was battered about as the beasts fought amongst themselves over who was going to be the one to eat him , knocking him away from the jaws of another for the chance to pick him off themselves .   Even after all of this the insatiable fiends were going to devour him . There was no escape . He staggered back and forth , senseless from the beating and crawling desperately for safety . Somewhere , anywhere for a brief respite .   With a howl , one of the beasts descended on its prize and David felt the jaws close around him . Darkness as they tugged him off his feet and drew him into its fetid gullet . He slithered down the beast 's throat and landed in its stomach , surprised to find that several of the others were alive and intact in here with him .   `` What the hell was all that ? What were they ? '' he asked .   The low hubbub of moans died down slightly as one tired old lady took his arm and helped him to his feet . `` We do n't know , '' she said . `` Whatever they were , they were very hungry . ''"}]}

Little Danny Jameson always gets his ice cream at this hour on the corner at 4:15pm . I took a quick look at my watch .    4:14pm .    I took a peek outside my window - a short chubby boy was eagerly waiting on the corner . An outdated melody grew closer and closer from the distance . Danny clapped his hands in excitement , the fat of his arms jiggling a little .    I carefully put on my coat as I heard the truck stop outside my house .    `` Hi Danny ! What can I get you ? ''    `` A super-shocker popsicle please ! ''    I was walking outside my house as the ice cream man began to drive away . Danny was eyeing his popsicle the way a lion stalks his prey .    `` Hey Danny ! '' I called out .    He looked up and smiled .    `` Hello Mr . Kim ! ''    I walked closer to him . `` What 's that you got in your hand ? ''    `` A super-shocker popsicle , sir ! '' He gave a big grin . `` They just came out last week ! ''    `` Wow , '' I feigned interest , `` You 've been saving your pocket money for that , huh ? ''    Danny gave an eager nod and began to open the wrapper .    I swatted the popsicle out of his hand and in one motion , smashed it underneath my foot .    Danny failed to comprehend what had just happened . It only took him several precious seconds before he gasped as he looked at his treat on the ground .    `` B-b-but ... ''    `` Fuck off , Danny boy '' I pushed him on the ground and strutted back into my house . Outside , I could hear the quiet weeping .    My cellphone rang as I took a look at the number - 'Unknown ' .    `` Hello ? ''    `` Hi , Mr . Kim ? ''    `` This is him speaking . ''    `` This is Penguinsssss Publishing and I found your novel from a friend of mine . I would love for us to get together sometime and discuss a deal . ''    This was it . My luck was finally changing .    `` Sure thing ! ''    `` Great ! I 'll be in contact with you again very shortly Mr. Kim , and welcome to Penguinsssss Publishing ! ''    I hung up and raised a fist in the air for celebration .    So why did I feel like shit ?    I took a look outside the window and saw Danny still on the ground . The ice cream was melting as he still looked as if in shock .    *Karma 's a bitch . *    I 've been living through with that my whole life , but then I realized .    *Karma may be a bitch , but it 's my bitch . *    I have lived with it for so long , I was used to it . I needed to be the victim .    I quickly put on my coat and ran outside .    `` Danny ? ''    `` Y-yes ? '' tear ran down his cheeks .    `` Look , I 'm sorry , '' I reassured him that I was n't going to hurt him , `` I ... I had a bad day and I 'm really sorry . ''    I pulled out my wallet and pulled out a ten-dollar bill .    `` I want you to go buy a whole pack of super-shocker popsicles tonight . ''    He wiped his tears and brightened up like a Christmas tree . `` Wow , you mean it ? ''    I gave him a simple nod .    `` No foolin ' ``   He eagerly took the bill and ran off back to his house . He waved me good-bye and yelled a `` Thanks Mr . Kim ! '' in my direction .    I anticipated the phone to ring again with a certain publisher telling me that he was n't going to go through with the deal .   But the phone never rang .    `` Ha , well what do you know ? '' I muttered as I began to take a walk across the street , `` Karma 's a bitch . ''    I never noticed the truck and the horrified driver through the headlights . My brain gave a little chuckle as I read the bumper sticker a foot in front of me .    **Karma 's a bitch**"}]}

I took a hefty dab of the Vics Vapo-rub from the large pot that they had open and hoped it would work . Even now that most of the bodies and remains had been removed , the smell had sunk into every surface within the house ; it would need to be bulldozed , ploughed into the earth and burned repeatedly to remove the smell and the memory of what happened here . I rubbed the Vics under my nose and wondered if it would keep the memories out as well as the smell .   This would be my third time inside the house and while I could happily live the rest of my life without having to consider it ever again , if we were going to get any information from the scumball who did this , then I needed my memory fresh .   I pushed through the door and into the kitchen , keeping to the narrow strip of paper that CSU had laid even though it wasn ' t strictly necessary anymore . That first night it had been dark in here when Jim and I had burst in , lured by the screams we ' d heard , not knowing what kind of a hell we were stumbling into .   The girl had begged us not to go but as soon as the ambulance had arrived and we ' d heard the scream , we knew we had to move . She ' d escaped an hour before , an hour for the sick bastard to start cleaning up , that ' s what we were worried about then , a lack of evidence . It seems almost funny now .   The kitchen that night had been dark and the smell only faint but Jim and I were both seasoned , we ' d both smelled decomp before . It took us only a minute to go through the small house , room by room , by the numbers . Jim had seen it , the crack of light that we might have missed if the lights had been on ; so many times when luck and coincidence had led us onwards , so many times in the past it had kept him concealed . If that girl hadn ' t managed to escape would he have ever been found ? If she ' d bled out in the snow , instead of making her way to the house across the field , would we have ever checked the small farm house with no registered owner ?   In the living room the trapdoor had been taken away now and the hole looked obvious , rigged up with a safety ladder to allow easy access in and out . That first time , clinging to the wooden slats as we made out way into the dark , only our flashlights illuminating the dark , that had been real terror . At the bottom when we ' d suddenly realised that he tunnels opened up and ran in both directions , now there were signs , lights and still some people pushing trolleys along full of evidence , despite a solid month of collecting . Back then it was dark and quiet .   I followed our original route , slowly moving along the wall and finding that first door in the dark ; now it was also gone , removed to be printed and checked , every inch examined . Inside the cages stood open , the bodies gone and the chains too , but back then they had been full . Girls had begged us , pleaded and screamed as they saw us come in . The arms and the stumps reaching through the bars haunted me and I could see them still , even in this lit , clean room .   I turned away , perhaps this had been a mistake , coming back here , trying to recapture that night to take it into the interrogation with me . Unthinking I moved along the corridor and entered another of the rooms , this one a clean computer room where he had run some of his terrible genetic experiments . At least it didn ' t hold any memories for me . A hand touched my shoulder and I flinched and spun , it was one of the techs who shrank back at my reaction .   \" Sorry ! I just need to get past. \" He carefully inched through and I realised that he had been standing behind me speaking for some time , I had just been lost in my thoughts . I watched as he disconnected yet another drive from the huge banks of computers along the wall and pulled out several new ones .   \" Still downloading this stuff ? \" I tried to normalise my voice , make it seem more steady .   He turned and evaluated me , seeing my badge and recognising me as a detective . \" Not much more now , the guys over at Johns Hopkins say they think we have about 90 % of what he was working on and they ' re hoping the last 10 % can be reconstructed . If we could get his encryption keys though we ' d be able to access it all so much quicker\u2026 \" He left it dangling in the air , that last great problem , even after all this work , we still needed the bastard ' s help .   I smiled grimly . \" I ' m working on it. \" And I meant it . I ' d seen enough , I didn ' t need to go through the tunnels , to see every inch of the place , as I had on my second visit . I didn ' t need to go back to that room , just down from here where Jim had opened the door to that\u2026 that thing and been eviscerated in a second . I didn ' t need to see every lab , every cage , every sick inch of the place as I had before , walking through in a space suit as they pulled bones from the very plaster of the walls .   I turned and walked out , back towards the ladder . I had what I needed , I had recaptured the smell of the place in my nostrils and now I was ready to confront him again and get what we needed ."}]}

Instinct takes over as anxiety ignites my body into a sudden violent spasm of fear , throwing myself off my bed , hitting the floor with a hard thud . Sweat covers my palms as my heart races and all of my internal alarms are ablaze as I see my unexpected guest jolts up , as if they were surprised . ''   `` BABY -- What the fuck ? ! '' she shouts with a sharp , high pitched voice .   My unexpected bedguest is a pale woman , with eyes a pale -- almost grey -- blue , curly reddish brown hair with thick locks . Freckles dot rosy red cheeks on a round face with bushy eyebrows . My rather unmanly screech of alarm has set her own anxiety a flare , as she looks back at me in concern .

She lowers her voice and maintains eye-contact , as if I were some frightened animal in her space , or as if I were somebody having an episode in a mental health facility .   `` Baby '' , she says calmly . `` It 's me ... just me . You know , you 're *wife* . It 's just me , Ohio . ''   Ohio ? *Ohio* ? Why in God 's name is there a naked woman in **my** bed ? Why is she calling herself my fucking wife ? Why the fuck is she named after my home state ?   She does n't break her gaze away from me , and I 'm still there , on the fucking floor , sweat escaping out of my orifices , heart pounding , and breath weezing .   `` Baby , '' she tells me again , reassuringly , `` It 's okay ... just ... let me go downstairs and get your meds .

Just ... chill the fuck out , alright ? ''   I swallow hard , a really loud gulp , and nod my head quietly . That much sounded familiar ; I do have a perscription for my anxiety . How the fuck did she know that ? I shift myself on the floor , waiting for my heart to slow down .   Ohio , or whatever the fuck her name is , gets out of bed and softly tells me it 's going to be okay . This short , curvy woman with a fairly flat chest steps out of my -- or our -- bed , and as I notice her walk on the door , I notice a tattoo above her buttcrack . I squint to make it out , and it dawns on me that this woman claming to be my wife , who slept in my bed , has a tattoo of the logo for the Ohio State Buckeyes , a scarlet and grey geometric O shape .   She exits the room , and I hear her soft footsteps go down the hardwood floor of the hall and head into the bathroom . I force myself to lay back down , and things in my environment are clearly out of fucking place . None of these things belong to me . My plain black comforter has been replaced by a Cleveland Browns one , there are posters on my white wall of the Cincinnati Bengals , and as I get up and brush aside the sliding door of my bedroom closet : nothing but woman 's sized Ohio State Buckeye football jerseys .

I 'm ready . ''   General Pratt nodded firmly , ceremoniously pushing open the double doors and leading the president inside . The tense hum of voices died down almost immediately as faces grew somber at her presence . There was another long silence before she spoke up . `` Well ? Give me the skinny , people . What do I need to know ? ''   General Pratt turned to face her in the absence of a response . `` Madam President ... what you 're about to hear tonight is top secret . Classified data beyond all other classified data . If any of this were to get out ... '' He shuffled his feet and glanced at his cohort . `` Well , suffice it to say that it ca n't get out . '' He turned away from her , nodding to a younger man sitting at the table . `` Jenkins , let 's start with you . ''   `` W-well , uh , first up I suppose we should talk about ... a-about area 51 , ma'am . You see , it's- uh , there are aliens there- '' a murmur ran through the room , and out of the president 's earshot , more than one member of the meeting muttered disappointment with Jenkins ' lackluster offering . Like a comic losing a crowd , he sputtered on without much enthusiasm until Pratt finally cut him off . `` Yes , yes- thank you , Jenkins , that was ... informative . The bottom line is that yes , we 've been conducting experiments on aliens at Area 51 , but that 's only the tip of the iceberg here , ma'am . '' In a lower voice , he confided `` You 'll have to forgive the poor boy , it 's his first time doing this , and he obviously is n't comfortable with the material . '' The president nodded , her expression surprisingly forgiving and understanding , perhaps due to the revelation of what Jenkins said rather than how he said it .   A woman only barely Jenkins ' senior stood next . Her uniform bore the surname 'Latrell ' . `` I think we can all agree that aliens obviously existed . No real surprise there . But you may not have guessed that aliens are n't the only non-human intelligent life forms we 're aware of , Madam . '' A few furtive looks flew between the others at the table . `` I 'm talking about a smaller scale of creature . You may know them better as pixies . '' The president 's eyebrows rose in a mix of surprise and skepticism . `` They 're not like they were in fairy tales , madam . From our research they appear to be some kind of offshoot branch of insect that somehow developed ... well , near-human levels of intelligence . They 're fast , they 're tiny , and they prefer to stay unseen , but those that we have captured have refused to give us any information as to their goals or roles in the ecosystem . '' Latrell sat quietly , confident in her report . The president sat back , clearly taken aback by this second piece of information . More hushed murmurs rolled back and forth across the room .   `` Let 's see , who wants to go next ? Ah , Muller , how about you ? '' An older but well groomed man stood , not in a uniform this time but in a neat grey suit . `` Yes , well , I do n't know what will shock you in the ... aftermath of the 'pixie ' briefing , but there are certainly other important things you should know . My area of focus over the last thirty years has been Russia . '' The newly appointed president , still struggling to come to terms with Latrell 's report , leaned forward eagerly . `` You see , you 've been told that some of Soviet Russia 's greatest leaders were dead and buried , but the truth is much more sinister . For one , Joseph Stalin is alive and well . That is , as well as one can be with a mechanical lower body . You see , he did n't die of a stroke . He was assassinated . Or rather , someone tried to assassinate him . The tissue damage was so severe that they had to cut him in half and put his torso on a sort of mechanical undercarriage . If you 've seen The Clone Wars , it 's kind of like that . ''   A brief look of confusion crossed her face . `` The Clone ... What ? ''   Muller continued without respite . `` That 's not the worst of it . You see , when Cyborg Stalin was only a boy , he had Karl Marx cryogenically frozen . After the assassination attempt , he thawed him out and went on to build a Soviet counterpoint to the idyllic 50 's America . An underground communist society , spearheaded as a collaboration between the two men ( though he 's more machine now than man ) . This secret communist sovereign nation still exists today , and we believe it is still being led by its original founders , who appear to have developed some kind of anti-aging technology thanks to the scientists who joined their secret nation . ''   The president pushed her chair back and stood , shock and fear painted across her face . `` I- I need some air , this is all too much . This is crazy . This is what Barack was talking about when he said there were things too crazy to believe ? No wonder he went grey . I need to ... I need to collect my thoughts . I need to tell someone about this . '' Pratt stood , his arms flailing . `` No , no , no ma'am , you can not tell a soul about this . Not even your husband . He has n't been updated on this information for decades . '' She shook her head , already typing up a storm on her phone . `` It 's okay , he 'll be the only one I tell , I just need to talk to him about this .

The back of the planet is covered in a single giant glacier . The part facing the suns is swamp-like around the outer edge , as it gets regular run off from the glacier as because of the elliptical orbit . And the central part is extremely dry and sandy . The entire planet is very hot .    Physical characteristics in human terms ( I use analogous structures to describe the body parts where that can be done . ) -   The species has a range of heights with between 7.5 and 10 ft tall being within the normal ranges . They vary in color from white to black with shades of blue-grey in the middle . This is from a combinations of cyanide and iron in the outer layers of their skin .   They are thin and flat , with no fat to speak of . They have heavy , calcified plating attached to their spines that protects their backs , necks and heads . It 's articulated and lays in layers . It 's used both in defense and for digging purposes . Their earlier ancestors used their bodies to burrow and the plating can be used to ripple loosened sand and sediment back .   Under the plating is thin skin that covers their external resp o-circulatory system . A deeper , inner system delivers oxygen and nutrients to a gelatin-like storage ( Kortimi ) that releases it to the body as there is a demand . The bulk of the ( kortimi ) is under the plating but there is some around the organs and along the front of their bodies and limbs .   They have four long and very flexible limbs . The limbs are thin to facilitate digging . The limbs are primarily bone , tendon , and skin . The bulk of the muscular work is done in the torso and proximal to the torso in the limbs .   They have eyes that are always open and require a lot of light ( by human standards ) to see . They are set into the face and covered in a hard , clear lens . The reason for that is their sun always being `` up . '' They navigate closed , dark spaces by sonar .   The face is a flattish curve . It leads the body when burrowing . The mouth is double hinged . Large , needle-like teeth fit closely together and are the main feature of the face . They are omnivores and are just as likely to chew through deep-grown roots as they are to eat lower species .   There are no external sexual characteristics but there are three sexes . The topic only comes up when they 're talking about children . The male of the species is universal but there are Swampland-females and desert-females . One carries children internally and another plants them externally . Externally is traditionally more acceptable making desert-females a more ideal mate .   Sexual maturity is characterized by a hardening of the plating on the back ( which continues to be worn down and grow through adulthood ) and a complete shedding of the skin which is extremely uncomfortable . The shedding also primes the immune system .   ___________________________________   Culturally -   There are four main classes in Tuaboz society :   Creators : Who study the sciences and make all the advances . They spend great deals of time observing applicators and devising ways things can be done better .   Applicators : Who take what the creators invent and perfect it . They do all the `` work '' of life .   Entertainers : Who dedicate all their time to doing things beautifully and learning all the arts . They are also the masters of ceremonies and are centerpieces of any gathering . Sometimes literally .   Children : Children are raised communally by Applicators who work in the field of childcare .   Children are held in low regard . It 's expected that after conception , thirty percent will never live , and forty percent of the ones that are born wo n't reach adulthood . Value comes with joining one of the other three classes . Children that die are discarded and recycled with no ceremony .   Children split themselves into natural groups at a young age . Carers make sure they learn all the factual information they need and teach the groups to interact in a very strict way and to be uncomfortable with anything less .   After sexual maturity , which varies from child to child , they are able to take apprenticeships and find their place . 15 - 20 % will be Creators , 70 % will be applicators and 10 - 15 % will be suitable for Entertainer status . Entertainer status is further broken down into `` Performers '' and `` Facilitators '' with only the most beautiful and perfectly formed becoming Performers . Each performer can expect to have eight to ten personal attendants .   Culturally , there are three rights of passage into adulthood . They often have chosen their living-partners by the time they reach puberty . Before leaving child-care , they have to register as individuals with the government with the names they have chosen or been given . They have to attend a show by the entertainers . And they are given information of their biological parents so they can predict for any future illness or concerns . Siblings sometimes contact each other on learning they are related just because they can , but hardly anyone meets their parents .   Their society is very collective . A good life is one of service . They work to be extremely efficient . They live in large , tightly knit groups , usually split along lines of who they got along with in childcare . A performer will usually live with all their attendants and any friends they have . Teams of creators and applicators generally also live together if they do n't have other arrangements . There are no work schedules except those set by teams . The planet does n't experience day/night cycles . People work when they are awake and have the energy .   When society became more structured , timing became necessary . The year is split into four seasons ( Two hot , two cold ) because of the elliptical orbit . Each season is split into 8 `` months . '' and each month into 16 `` days . '' Each day has 1024 `` minutes . '' These are only really used to schedule things between parties .   The thought process is extremely literal . They do n't have imagination at all and they have no words for imaginary things . There are lies and there is some concept of lies that are impossible , but it 's limited and only used for games among adults . A brainteaser of sorts .   Interactions among ones living-partners and strangers is extremely different . People who live together create their own culture in their homes . They are very open with how they feel and spend great amounts of time talking about it . When strangers meet , the actions are extremely formal and regimented . It 's extremely rare that anyone is invited to anyone else 's house or work . The only exception being people working in applications that provide an in-house service . Usually the entire household will leave so the work can be done .   They often do things because they can . The main characters of the story are on a ship that left the planet 700 earth-years earlier . They left to see what their moon was . Then they took notice of other planets and went to see those . And then they kept going . They find Earth because they were wandering in that direction anyway , hit some early radio waves scattered to space , and followed . They never thought to go back to the planet even after they lost contact , because the ship was self-sustaining and they were able to continue was reason enough to go .   _____________________________________________   The habitable half of the planet is peppered with densely populated cities . The population is stable , neither rising or falling , because it 's tightly controlled . The cities do n't communicate much except in a few specific scenarios :   Childcare workers rotate each season to ensure children are getting uniform , unaltered instruction . Creators communicate to each other through a huge `` internet . '' When they discover a better way to do something . They suggest it and other creators can decide whether or not it 'd be wise to implement it into their own city .   Entertainers travel with their attendants three times a year to a large , centeral ceremony . And twice a year to internal competitions that no one outside their group sees .   Outside of that , there is minor amounts of trade between cities and sometimes resources will be pooled for extremely large projects .   _________________________________________________   WOW .

But I knew I could n't leave , it had been 5 years since John and David and I had done this . Doing what exactly ? I thought as we all sat under the frigid California night sky , with our faces lit up from our phone screens . It 's not like anyone is talking , I looked for some excuse to awkwardly fidget on my phone while I waited for someone to break the silence .    **bzzz bzzz** My phone vibrates . Great , now she 's worried and wants to know where I am .    I finally decide to break the silence , `` rem ... '' I murmur under my breath trying to get their attention . John looks up at me and then back down at his phone . Life used to be a lot simpler back then ; when we spent time together , we actually talked , laughed and made memories . What am I going to remember about today 10 years from now ?    **bzzz bzzz** Another text . Why would she call the police , she knows I 'm with my friends .    My best memory of us was the last time we were here ; it was the night after prom . It was just the three of us , drunk of our whisky flasks . We never really figured out how we made the drive here alive . Nevertheless , laughing away we reminisced over the best times we had together . Ha , it ' s funny how technology has now made us strangers .    **bzzz bzzz** `` I hope you did n't drive drunk again . '' That was over 8 years ago ! Why won ' t she stop nagging me about that !    Fuck it , I have a long day tomorrow , both of them are on their phones so it ca n't be rude for me to fall asleep . I bet they wo n't even notice .    **A couple of hours later..**    I hear footsteps getting closer to me , still half asleep I look up and see her trembling with fear and sadness . She keeps quiet , struggling to hold her tears back . Dazed and confused , I wonder what I 've done . I cautiously pull out my phone , fuck it ' s 8 am , and I ' ve missed work . The last text I received from her , `` I wish you had accepted it and moved on . They would 've wanted you to ... '' I look around me , where did David and John go ? Where did that bottle of whisky come from ?    Recovering from my drunken stupor , it finally dawns on me again ; that night quickly flashes through in my mind . A surge of guilt , pain and sorrow gushes through my body . I would give anything to take their place . Why ca n't it make the pain go away forever ? Why ca n't I make them come back ? I take another swig and go back to living my lie .   EDIT : sentences , words and grammar"}]}

It was probably in the quadruple digits by now , maybe even past 2000 . It was embarrassing to go out in public with such a high number , but they didn ' t pay him to sit at home and wallow in his discomfort . As he stepped on the bus he looked around and saw a smattering of numbers , the bus driver smiled at him under a green **75** , the old woman in the handicapped seat had a reddish **15** above her white hair . An attractive woman in a pencil skirt and blouse mounted the bus slightly after him and blushed slightly as she caught him glancing at the deep red **3** hovering above her perfectly coiffed blond curls .  He watched as the baby in the stroller sleeping peacefully had a green **108** flip silently to a green **1** while her mother had a light red **620** plastered over mousy brown hair pulled back in a ponytail . The mother glanced down at the baby and sighed tiredly .    Out of sheer professionalism , numbers were largely ignored in the office . No one needed a distraction amid all the stress , but he could tell his supervisor was judging him by the slightly grimaced look she gave him when she glanced at his number . It was probably over 2000 by now ! She smiled fakely at him from under her green **220** and gave him his assignments for the day .    On his way back to his desk , he stopped by the kitchen and grabbed a bowl of cereal and poured in some milk . He always ate breakfast at his desk .   He could tell his coworkers were avoiding him , probably because of the huge number over his head . They all traipsed past him , with numbers varying from the single digits all the way up to triple digits . Quads , those with four digits , were not really something to worry about , until they started getting up into the 3000 and over range . Still , you undoutedly felt uncomfortable once your number was in the thousands . If your number got too high , white coated authorities may detain you . No one really knew where they took the high quads , but they were often back less than a week later , usually with green numbers within the normal range .    \" Morning Sean \" muttered Frank as he hurried past with a dark red **342** trailing slightly behind his bald head . Before Sean could respond , Frank was lost in the shuffle of desks and people . Sean turned back to the fiber-bomb cereal that had become mushy in the cold milk during the walk from the kitchen to his desk .     As he filed his reports all morning , he wasn ' t sure if it was what he knew was an absurdly high number over his head that just kept getting higher , or the bowl of the fiber bombs , but his stomach simply would not stop churning . It felt like someone had released a family of hamsters into his large intestine , and now they were doing their best ( the hamsters ) to reenact civil war battles , cannons and all . Twice he had to walk outside when the flatulence grew either too sonorous or too pungent .    Lunch , due to his gastrointestinal bellum , was a light affair , a salad from downstairs with a glass of water . His supervisor stopped by his desk while he was eating with a sheaf of papers , undoubtedly more reports for him , but upon catching sight of his number , definitely well over 3000 by now , she instead asked him if he needed to take the afternoon off .    \" Nah , I ' m fine. \" He lied . The hamsters had moved on from civil war reenactment to WWI . Long moments of utter stillness followed by minutes of extreme distress as the hamsters rushed from one trench to another . He was sure that if he lifted his shirt and watched , he would see the horror of what was happening underneath reflected in violent movements under his hairy stomach .    \" Suit yourself\u2026 \" She started to say something , but stopped and walked off and handing the reports to Frank , who now had a green **165** practically shining above his head .    Less than an hour after lunch Sean felt the gastrointestinal pressure build . He was in the middle of a conference call when it hit . He stood up suddenly , forgetting his headset and pulled his phone off the desk . It fell with a clatter , but he didn ' t care . He almost didn ' t make it , Frank , with his smug **215** decided he needed to catch up and apologize for his hurried greeting earlier that day . Sean disposed of Frank with a wave and hurried by , hoping his light khakis would not turn into dark brown khakis on the way to the restroom . He burst into the rest room , startling the intern washing his hands at the sink ( a green **3** over his head ) . Before Sean was even in the stall , he was unbuckling his belt and as he squeezed himself into the small stall , he threw down his pants , pirouetted ungracefully , sat down with a thud , and relaxed as a feeling of release rushed through him . The hamsters made a quick retreat . Fifteen minutes later he walked out of the restroom , relieved , with a bright green number **2** over his head ."}]}

First of all , Halloweenie was in my bedroom . Second of all , he was holding a carving knife up to a pumpkin . Third of all , the pumpkin was *screaming* .   `` What are you doing ? '' I snatched the pumpkin away from him and cradled it in my arms . The wailing abated , replaced with muffled sobs . They sounded vaguely familiar .   `` This pumpkin has no mouth ! '' Halloweenie shook his knife with exasperation . `` It desires release only I can provide . ''   `` Why was it screaming ? What are you even doing in my room ? Where did Erin go ? '' I glanced between the disheveled bed and Halloweenie 's glowing wand . Fury began welling up inside me as my brain made the connection . `` Why ? ''   Halloweenie shrugged . `` Look , you know the feeling : you 're walking down the street , you see a perfect molded figurine of a person\u2014 '' He traced the outline of a deformed hourglass with his chubby hands . `` \u2014and you get the urge to , y'know , use their body as a sculpting block . ''   I shook my head , agape . `` No ? ''   `` Well , you are n't really the intellectual type , I guess . '' Halloweenie thumbed his chin . `` What about this : you ever get the urge to go up and punch a guy in the face , just to see what would happen ? ''   His pudgy nose was looking like a really tempting target right about now . I clenched my fists and took a deep breath . `` What 's your point ? ''   `` Well , sometimes you just get the urge to turn a girl into a pumpkin . ''   `` Sometimes '' was more like `` all the time . '' It was the middle of summer , but Halloween was a year-long celebration for Halloweenie . During his week here , he had reanimated corpses in my living room , dumped some skeletons in my closet , and turned my dog into a werehuman . Enough was enough .   `` I do n't care about your urges . You need to learn some impulse control like the rest of us . '' I set down the pumpkin on the floor between us . `` Now change her back . ''   `` Well , you told me I should manage my impulses better . '' Halloweenie adjusted his glasses with the tip of his wand . `` So I 'll have to think about it . ''   `` Change her back , or I 'm kicking you out . '' The words exploded from my mouth in an uncontrollable bark . This was not an ultimatum I could enforce ; Halloweenie could just turn me into a pumpkin if he so pleased . Still , it was a fate preferable to one as a doormat .   `` Come on , lighten up . '' He offered me a sheepish smile : it was apologetic only in appearance . `` Ca n't you at least appreciate the artistic merit of all this ? '' He stretched his arms out , and cobwebs began to spread across my ceiling .   `` Okay . Do n't change her back then . Just get out . '' I stormed over to the door and thrust it open , motioning for him to leave . `` I 'll find some wizard who 's not a Halloween-obsessed freak and have them undo your creepy magic . ''   Halloweenie 's composure seemed to shatter at that remark . A film of water glistened in his eyes before he blinked it away . `` Fine , '' he said , his voice cracking . He waved his wand , and a plume of smoke erupted from the floor . When it cleared , he was gone , as was the pumpkin , and Erin was back . She ran over to me and buried her head in my chest , forcing my neck upwards . The cobwebs were still there . Fucker .   `` Oh , thank goodness you got rid of him , '' she said , digging her fingernails into my back . `` Being a pumpkin was ... just ... ''   `` It 's okay . He 's gone for good now . '' I began to rub Erin 's back , but she suddenly wrenched away from me .   `` It 's too late , '' she said , sinking to her knees , `` I was a pumpkin for too long . ''   `` What ? ''   `` You need to bring him back . '' Erin sobbed into the floor . `` I ca n't live as a human anymore . You need to tell Halloweenie to change me back into a pumpkin . ''   Dread crept into my stomach as I joined Erin on the floor , brushing her hair away from her cheek . `` Pumpkin ... I mean , Erin . No . What are you talking about ? '' That fucker would pay . I 'd stick a razor in his candied apple . I 'd carve a Jack O'Lantern into his face .   As I stroked Erin 's face , something scratched me . I slid my finger along her cheek , tracing the path of the sensation . It was a seam . I gripped it and pulled : her entire face tore away to reveal a layer of wizened skin underneath . The impostor turned to look at me , and I found myself face-to-face with my least favorite wizard . He took the discarded mask and held it out in front of me like a pouch .   `` Trick or treat !

I yearned , like so many of our kind to devour and digest . As a young catipillar it is all you think about . There is no room for other pleasures in the minds of youth . Devour , digest , devour , digest . It continues on this way ; an exciting affair to be alive and healthy , thriving in the vastness of the green expanse . Until one day it hits you their is so much more to living then simply surviving . I do n't judge the youth for thier lack of experience anymore than I judge the industrious ant for its greed and totalitarianism . It is simply their way . The maple leaf 's edge was inviting . It was the freshest smelling leaf I 'd come across in the dozen suns since my birth . For hours , maybe more I consumed it . I lost myself in the worldy pleasure , rested , ate again then rested some more . Another sun had passed before I regained a inkling of awareness . I was sated . The distraction of sustenence had diminished and the potential for learning swept into its place . I watched through a tiny gap in the trees where no branches crossed . Rarley did I let myself apprecaite the beauty of the sky . The white bodies flew across the vast open plane of blue and did so with such grace but after some time of pondering my place in the forest they began a process of expansion ; turning from a light hearted white to a distainful gray . They engorged themselves , sometimes consuming a neighbor but often just expanding on their own . How did they do this ? It was a wonderful question that inspired my ongoing quest for knowledge . Soon my body tingled and felt light ; if I was n't firmly planted on the sweet maple leaf , I might have acended through the canopy and found out what the white beasts in the sky were so excited about . But I did n't ; I could n't . Although I did n't know it , my time above the trees would come soon enough . The rain drops poured onto my head . The rain itself was n't bothersome in my state of contentment but the noise , the collosal banging above the trees was harrowing . A sudden , disctinct urge to move came over me . At the time I could n't describe what it was , but it was strong . Like the winds of the storm it caught me off guard , but I followed my instict to find shelter . The large leaves of the maple provided cover from the above but did nothing for the increasing winds coming at me from the side . On the way up the tree , I had n't noticed any crevices to crawl my way into . My imagination began to run wild like the wolf packs often did . Howling and screaming . Biting and tussling . It was unbearable to think of what might happen if I fell into the ants territory . It would certainly spell a slow and agonizing death , I knew that much . It was hard to hear over the roar of the storm but definetly distinguishable . Footsteps . Crunching leaves . The deer often stepped on a twig or two by mistake but this footfall was lazy . Like it did n't care if it was heard or seen . Was the wall of water distorting the image or was this creature a two legged one ? I 'd seen creatures with more legs than mine . It certainly was n't unusual . The web trappers wore eight , but six was the most common among the smallest of us . The giant beasts on the ground never had more than four . As it approached its nightmarish outline and its deformities became apparent . It did had four legs ! But did n't use all of them . Two hung uselessly at its side . The way it sludged through the forest with no awareness was discomforting . Was it stupid or overconfident ? Nevertheless it was a monster of terrible porportions . It 's head passed the neighboring maple and cleared the third teir of branches . It was n't just ugly , it was massive . Tall . And getting earily closer to my safe haven .   A thousand winds could n't pull me from that leaf but the moster plucked me off like a ripe acorn . It was a nightmare come true with all the images to haunt you for the rest of your days but what I remember the most was the stench . Everything in the forest was pleasant , always with a lingering sweetness to it . But the man , the man was unatural . Unearthly smells that stole the air and made your head spin . It placed me in the palm on its furless paw and turned me to the darkened sky . I decided then and there that I was truly at my end . I saw past the monstrosity and it 's odors that held me prisoner and instead , imagined the beauty of my life till that moment . My mind wandered and enjoyed the simplicity of my own imagination . I remembered the pleasures of eating , resting , and learning . It was a good life , short but incredibly sweet .   I felt the swaying of wind trying to penetrate my daydream of the oblivion and soon felt the security of my maple underfoot . The storm had past as if all a fabrication . The sun saw past the furious clouds and wisked them away . I did not fall to a fate worse than death nor did I succumb to the mosters toxicity . I was free . I celebrated my life in a few short moments and then felt hungry . So I ate until the mighty sun was replaced by another . My stomach full on maple yet again , I decided to never stop learning about the wonders of the forest ahead .   *Sorry if their are grammatical or spelling errors . Did n't have time to edit ."}]}

I don ' t care , I ' ve heard them all at this stage and I hate myself for still burning up inside every time .   Gerry brushes it off but I can see the water in his eyes .

I look at him and see a brief glimpse in his eye . The poor guys been getting it worse than I ever did . With his stutter and the fact that his Mother left him and his Father when he was a kid , he never had a chance in this jungle .   I decide to push him a bit more .   \" Come on Ger , are you telling me you ' d be happy seeing Kevin leave here with the prettiest girl and inherit his rich asshole dad ' s business and making more money than we can ever dream of ? \"   His brow lowers .

I look at my notepad and see scribbles of guns and the flag on fire and think to myself , Jesus , I ' m just like everyone else . A fraud , a liar and a hypocrite .   I think about my conversation with Gerry earlier . Was I really serious about murdering a group of people just for making fun of me ? And what the hell was that shit about Columbine ?   Shit . I better text Gerry telling him I was blowing off steam . Why do I always overreact to everything ?

Half from ... what I was up to and the other half from realising my best friend is a psychopath . I had to do something . Be the hero .   Be the hero ? Me ? Shit , that ' s a lot of pressure for a 15 year old . I don ' t even know what I want to be when I grow up\u2026   That said\u2026   I could grow up a hero . That could open a lot of doors for me .

I mean my dad doesn ' t even have a rifle , why did I lie about that ? To be cool ? And for who ? Gerry ?   God Dammit .   I go to the toilet . I take a piss and hop in the shower . I wash myself . I get out . I wipe the mirror from steam .   I look like shit .   Then it dawns on me ! I shove two fingers down my throat and hurl chunks of last night ' s pasta down the toilet . I keep going until I ' m violently , and more importantly , loudly retching . I laugh at my self , muttering ' mom ' s spagetti ' in a moment of dizzy delusion .   ' Jesus Matthew ' I hear from the door frame . ' You look like crap ! '   Good old easy to manipulate mom I think to myself , oblivious of the fact that I probably did serious damage to my trachea .   \" Right back into bed . No way you ' re leaving the house in this state \"   A wave of euphoria washes over me . This must be what its like to smoke ecstasy or eat molly or whatever they were talking about in gym that day . I ' m also pretty whacked out of it from the purge I just had .   \" oh ... no\u2026 \" I manage to mumble out . Even my grin can ' t betray my happiness . Jesus , I must really be a mess .    **____**   12.30 - Recess   Or at least it would be if I wasn ' t shivering in bed . I must of really fucked myself up . Oh well , small price to pay to avoid making life-altering decisions like martyring myself after a killing spree or slaying the beast that was once my best friend for the glory of ... girls and\u2026 well that was it really .

At least she was an organ donor though , so it 's not as if her death was in vain .   A month after my mother 's death , I get scheduled for an operation . Apparently it was something big , like , some organ that 's apparently vital to my survival ? Not really my business but yeah .   So surgery goes fine , I wake up with a fresh new-old ... . something . Hm , that 's weird , I ca n't remember what .

Random black spots are appearing but that 's not really consistsent with how energetic I 've been feeling . It 's almost like I 'm a new person .   Some people in black robes are coming up to me now , but they look like nice people . They just lifted up my shirt and- Whoa , why 's there a pentagram carved into my stomach ? Pretty spooky I guess , but the new me is n't quite so scared as I should be .   And now they 're chanting in like , Latin or something ? People these days , eh . Though were the hospital 's walls always so black and red ? That color scheme 's kind of dark if you ask me . No , not dark - like , ominous or something ? And now I 'm looking at me . I dunno how , I guess there 's a giant-ass mirror in front of me or something . Yeah , that makes sense . Steam 's everywhere , there are horns and glowing red eyes on me . Whoa . This is how I wanted to have looked in college , but now I 'm supposed to be a respectable member of society .   I turn to the nearest person draped in black and ask if I can get these decorations off . I mean they 're cool and all but I have a job interview this Saturday and I kinda need it . His chanting kinda faltered but I do n't blame him , after all , if I looked at myself I would probably be confused too . Oh wait , I already am .   Well I 'm sure it 's all gon na be okay . My body 's exploding out in flames now , but this surgery must have worked miracles because I 'm still feeling great . I 'm humming out the tune to `` Staying Alive '' as I decide to finally get up and walk around . I mean this place is supposed to be scary , but I 'm not scared at all .

Although I did n't choose to go in , I fell .  I just wanted to roam Havada collecting plants and documenting the natural wonders . I did n't want to go through adulthood .

I remember the feeling I had when I fell in . It was of reject and discomfort . I did not accept my fate . I was ignorant .  `` You will not progress '' the voice states .  `` PLEASE ! '' I scream . My heart had changed . Not just spiritually , physically it began to beat in fear , it noticed the mistake my mind had made . I did n't want anything to end . I just was n't ready for anything to begin .  My arm raises itself . I could n't control it . It had a strength I never possessed which dominated my control . A light appeared in my palm .  `` You end , Bleh'algma ''  My hand forces itself through my chest with a painful pressure I had never experienced .  `` Maybe I was ready for an adventure '' I say as my tears float off into the nothingness distance . As my sight blurs I see a being stand before me . Stocky and muscular . `` Who.. '' I being to say as I realize the future me fades off into ash as my vision darkens .

'' Aria acknowledged grudgingly .   `` Aria ... '' Zhavuul replied in equal discretion .   `` Listen ... '' Aria began bitterly , `` I do n't like you , and you do n't like me- ''   `` So if you shut the fuck up , we can figure out this problem for a moment . '' Zhavuul mentioned . Aria quieted down at the vicious reply and joined him in his gaze at the domicile of their newly acquired asset .   You see , Aria and Zhavuul , despite their differences had experience with one another . And whether they were okay with it or not , the fact they had actually done battle with each other once before put them in a special branch of their jobs as angels or demons . Known as the `` United Ethics Task Guild '' , it was a joint branch between Heaven and Hell themselves ; used for ambiguous cases on Earth involving the afterlife . Unfortunately for these two ; this was their first case .   `` I wonder what happened to them ? '' Aria said as she remembered the information passed down to them . Five different angels and demons ; and no one had seen them since . It had been a couple of years since the last ones had gone missing actually , so the case was still open .   `` Instead of going down there , '' Zhavuul proposed , `` Let 's see how he does on his own for once . ''   `` That 's against orders and you know it ! '' Aria chided .   `` Ah , *your* orders , not *mine* ... '' Zhavuul explained . Aria cringed as he smiled ; that awful hateful smile of his that always seemed to set the mood for something devastating in nature . They suddenly turned their attention to the house and were , for a moment , surprised at their target .   For starters , he was not a small child like they expected . Instead , he had to be at least 17 years old . Scraggly , dyed hair covered his head , his clothes grungy yet obviously with the times , a cigarette dangling from his mouth , the end already lit . But it was him alright ; Carl Ramone Shawnders .   `` Alright Mom , I heard you the first time ! '' Carl said bitterly as he left to his truck , `` Always talking shit ... ''   They watched him crank over the bizarre carriage from above , as he quickly left the small roadway in reckless fashion . They watched him , as he smoked cigarettes , and played music loudly , and drove too fast . He barely avoided hitting a child on his way to school . He swore , he used drugs and he slacked in class ; much to Zhavuul 's amusement .   However , he later attended church that night , visited his loving , elderly grandmother in the hospital , and worked a part-time job at night , giving Aria more faith in her cause . After helping a close friend home from a local party after having too many to drink , he bought some more Xanax , went home , and settled in for the night .   Zhavuul and Aria watched him pop a pair of the pills , and take a hit from a bong he kept near his bed . Settling into place on the bed ... Carl sat up .   `` Goddammit . Not again . '' He said in exhaustion , `` I can fucking see you . Both of you ! ''   Aria and Zhavuul were taken aback . Carl continued staring in their direction , and for a moment , they did n't know who he was talking to .   `` Do n't act like you 're invisible . '' Carl continued , `` You do this shit everytime . You stand around , and follow me all over the place , and then try to convince me to be on your side . Either of you . I had to deal with the last one 's bullshit too , so make it quick . I do n't have all night . ''   `` Uh , okay . '' Zhavuul began , `` Take heed mortal ! I Zhavuul , The Damned , command- ''   `` Hey save it asswipe ! I had to deal with the demon before you ! '' Carl pointed angrily , `` He talked the same shit all the time . Tell me what else is new ? Ladies first ! ''   Aria pointed to herself as Carl began motioning to have her come over .   `` I 've never had them send two before . '' Carl said as he popped another Xanax , `` What 's the deal . ''   `` Mortal , we- '' Aria opened .   `` Quit calling me 'mortal ' . I 'm not twelve . '' Carl beckoned .   `` Fine . Carl , is it . '' Aria said as she watched him nod , `` We 've been looking for our coworkers who 've disappeared on your watch . ''   `` I ai n't got anything to do with it , not my problem . '' Carl said , as he attempted to lay down .   `` How can you see us again ? '' Zhavuul wondered . He watched Carl sit up and study him ; completely unfazed by his terrifying characteristics .   `` I 've had the sight since I was a child , and I 'm *high as Jimi Hendrix* . '' Carl acknowledged , `` The better question would be 'how could I not ' ? ''   `` I actually like Jimi , he 's a good guy . '' Aria randomly trailed off .   `` Look that 's nice , but I have to sleep , so can you please get the f- '' Something began ringing in the bed , and Zhavuul and Aria got into fighting form while searching for the sound .   `` Hello ? '' Carl asked . They turned to see him coddling a small synthetic rectangle next to his ear .   `` Yeah , what about Reggie ? '' Carl said as he listened , `` WHAT ? When ? *Now* ? FUCK ! Okay , okay okay , look , yeah , look . I 'll meet them at the hospital , okay ? Trust me ! '' He hung up and quickly began getting dressed .   `` Reggie is n't doing too well ... '' Zhavuul perked up in anticipation .   `` No , he 's not . '' Aria noted , `` He probably will die tonight . ''   `` Not if I have anything to say about it .

A pleasant sun was shining through his bedroom window . It ' s rays caught and gleamed off little specks of dust floating in the air . Somewhere outside a robin chirruped it ' s greeting to the beautiful day .   \" Shit-ass fuck ! \" Joshua tried to exclaim . It came out as a groggy mumble while he rolled out of bed and clumsily snatched his cell phone off the end table . His shift started at 5:00 and the day had moved well beyond that .   *Where ' s the alarm ? Piece of junk phone can ' t even do one thing ... * His train of thought abruptly derailed as he realized : *This isn ' t my phone . *   It was similar to his phone the way that every phone is similar nowadays ; small , thin and sleek . On the screen there were no notifications . No angry calls from his manager or texts from concerned workmates . All it displayed was the date , time and the number three .   August 9 , 2016 . 7:37 am .   On the back of the phone a little folded pamphlet was secured with a strip of Scotch tape . He scratched at the chin stubble he wouldn ' t have time to shave . The panic Joshua felt for being late was replaced by sheer bewilderment . He unfolded the leaflet and saw curt instructions written in several languages . He muttered the English version to himself .   \" Swipe up or down to select the time you wish to overtake . Press and hold the red button for three seconds to engage the transformation . The counter displays remaining uses . Held possessions travel with you. \" He glanced around his room . Looking for an answer and seeing only dirty laundry and old furniture .   *A time machine ? What kind of a joke is this ? * His thoughts this time where replaced with sudden melancholy . *Whatever . No matter what ' s really going on I ' m toast anyways . The boss man said this was my last chance and here I am sitting at home two hours late . Maybe my sister will let me move back in with her . * He idly scrolled the time to 4:00 am . *Not likely after last time . Another worn out welcome . * He pressed his thumb down . *If only this thing was real . All the mistakes I could fix . I could go back and do it all right ... *   A sudden pressure hit him . A feeling like being inside an airplane as it takes off , but without the noise and from every direction . As quickly as it came it left . He was still sitting on the edge of his bed still holding on to what wasn ' t his phone . His room was exactly as it was before , only darker . Like putting on a pair of shades or as if it was earlier in the morning ...   *Holy sweet mother of everything it worked . * The sun wasn ' t quite up yet . It was earlier . He had travelled back in time . Joshua slowly raised himself to the window . *Could it be real ? How is this possible ? * His mind raced with the possibilities . He could travel anywhere in time ! He could do anything !   A hand shot from the gloom behind him . It covered his mouth while another arm wrapped his neck into a vicious hold . He struggled and tried to fight back . What was that trick his cousin showed him for getting out of headlocks ? He couldn ' t remember .   \" I don ' t have time for this , \" Came a low graveled voice from behind him . \" Joshua , stop , \" Joshua did stop . The intruder dragged him back to the center of the room and loosed his grip slightly . \" Weird shit is happening to you right now. \" The voice whispered \" I ' m here to fix it . When I let go , do nothing . Say nothing . When I leave , pretend I was never here , aye ? \" Joshua nodded as much as he could while being detained . The stranger released his grip and Joshua remained stone still out of fear and shock . The stranger moved slowly , almost painfully it seemed , over to the bed . With one swift motion the stranger ripped the covers off the bed and clamped a dirty rag over the revealed sleepers mouth .   Joshua was dazed by the sight before him . There in his bed was another person , but not just any person ; another self . That version of himself let out a muffled cry then quickly fell back into unconsciousness from whatever the old man had forced him to inhale . With surprising strength the stranger hefted the comatose clone over his shoulder and shuffled back across the room . He stopped next to Joshua and stared into him , holding out his free hand .   \" Give it to me. \" The stranger looked tired . More so then anyone Joshua had ever seen . His clothes were strange and ragged . He had several poorly healed scars on his face . His matted hair rolled down past his shoulders and mostly covered his eyes . The eyes told everything . They were the same eyes Joshua looked into when he looked in the mirror . \" Now ! I don ' t have much time ! \"   Joshua slowly moved his hands to the stranger . Cradling the time machine like a precious artifact . The old Joshua hastily grabbed it from him and began sliding through dates with a practised efficiency .   \" Wish me luck , lad . Hopefully you 'll never see us again. \" He pressed down on the phone and after a brief pause vanished . Joshua stood for a few minutes before his mind decided it could accept reality once again . Everything was the same . Normal . And there on his end table was his phone . Was it really his phone ? It looked the same but it seemed shinier , newer then he remembered it . He picked it up gently just as it began to beep out an alarm .   August 9 , 2016 . 4:15 am . Get up . Go to work ."}]}

Now , I have an opportunity to work with kids that were just like me at that age and help them make better choices .   I hopped into the cab of the brown , battered F-350 with a 200 gallon water tank fixed to the back . Kids called it `` The Camel '' and I used to fill their water bottles during the day .   I started the truck and reached instinctively for the pack of cigarettes in my shirt pocket . The pocket lay flat and empty . Quitting was n't an easy endeavor . But neither was correcting the course these boys were on ad I wanted to set a good example where I could . Even the little things count .   As I pulled away from D tents site I heard my name , Mr. Sir , being called . I assumed it was a thank you and waved out the window . It was probably the most affection these poor boys had gotten in years . Most came from broken homes , from parents who did n't care about them and those thoughts only serve to fuel my resolve to help these boys . Only someone who 's been where they 've been could help , I knew that . That 's why I took it upon myself to be a mentor and , if you will , a surrogate father . I reminisced about my own father . He was n't around for long and my memories were short , suffice to say , I was better off without him . But not without a strong male presence which is something I tried my utmost to give to these poor , poor boys .   My mouth itched in that special way when it needs a cigarette . Recalling I had none in my pocket , I reached towards the passenger seat for my 5 lb . bag of sunflower seeds . My hand came down on nothing but cracked vinyl . I glanced down , the bag was gone .   In an instant , I had the truck turned around . The parenting book on tape in the truck said that punishment had to be handed out swiftly or it would n't be associated with the action . As I pulled up I saw Magnet throw Caveman something . It flopped through the air and I recognized it as my bag of seeds . I parked the truck and walked up to the boys .   `` Caveman '' I said , trying to keep my voice even and calm , `` what 's that in your hole ? ''   He denied it at first . Stating he did n't know what it was .   I stared at him . Hard . I wanted him to tell me the truth and it was all I could do not to turn on Magnet and target him as the guilty one .   `` I took the bag out of your truck , Mr . Sir . ''   I wanted to cry . He had n't taken it . He 'd just been the guy left with the bag , he 'd done nothing wrong but there was nothing I could do without a confession from Magnet   `` Get in , I think the warden would like to see what you found .

The linguist immediately swept the tome into her shawl and tried to sponge away the spilled coffee , heedless of stains to her clothing .   Mindy , however , carried on with her day and soon forgot the encounter with the Romani linguist .

Everyone laughed and Mindy grew ever more frustrated . A later post about wedding proposals led only to further embarrassment :   *Do you think the guy should get down on one knee and ask your dad for permission ? I do ! # tradition*   One commenter quipped , `` As far as I know , my dad is already married , and also not gay . ''   The curse started to affect Mindy 's work life as well .   `` I want you , '' she said to a co-worker . After an uncomfortably long pause , she managed to continue , `` to send me those notes from Thursday 's meeting ! ''   Her co-worker began to avoid her . As the cringe-worthy incidents continued to pile up , Mindy felt she was nearing the end of her rope . Finally she returned to the market to find the Romani linguist and beg her to end the curse . As luck would have it , the linguist 's stall was still there .   `` Please make it stop ! '' Mindy said . `` I ca n't take it anymore ! ''   The linguist smiled an unpleasant smile . `` Have you learned the importance of being mindful ? ''   `` Yes ! I 'm sorry ! ''   `` Too bad , '' sniffed the linguist . `` That was one of my favorite books you spilled coffee on . Go away . ''   Mindy began to cry ."}]}

It looks like you 're failing .\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dr. Preston sat at his desk , impatiently twirling his pen and shooting glances at the clock . It was ten till eleven , and his clients were very punctual , but the wait was excruciating . These particular clients were seeking martial advice . While not Preston 's specialty , not uncommon . His mind had cracked the psychological issues others deemed impossible : histrionic personality disorder , Pica , disassociate disorder . There was even a man with Frotteurism who would not stop assaulting people on the bus before Preston helped him overcome the rape he had endured as a child . It was two till eleven when the doctor heard the door to his lobby open and the couple talk to his receptionist .   For all his gifts of the mind , Dr. Preston was not a physically impressive specimen . His massive stained oak desk was a safe fortress he could sit behind , without exposing his short legs and thin arms . The woodwork was ornate enough that many patients forgot there was a man behind it at all . Of course he was aware of his own self criticisms and psychosis . Like any good therapist he blamed his mother and older sister . He often sweat the collar of his shirt and tapped his shoes too much whenever he sat down . Spinning his pens was reserved for only the most stressful situations . Carolin was one such situation .   She was tall , with slender arms , and thin but not so disgustingly underfed like you see younger women now . She had the figure of a mother ( though she had no kids ) and the weight to show for it . But it suited her in Dr. Preston 's opinion . She was just round enough to wrap his arms around , though he hard certainly never done so . Her hair was auburn , and it fascinated him to stare at the brownish-red waves . Admittedly he should have been listening , but he was enchanted far beyond professionalism by now .   On her arm , yes they were linking arms again , was her husband Mark . He was , by typical definitions , handsome . He was a professional runner , long legs and nearly zero body fat by this point . His features were sharp , and his voice was booming ( overpowering even ) . But Mark looked different ; tired , unwell , and worn-down . The doctor tried not to feel excited at seeing him so weathered in body and spirit . He tried , but failed .   `` Good morning Stephensons . '' Dr. Preston 's tone had a hint of anxiety he could not hide .   `` Morning doctor , '' Carolin almost bounced with each syllable .   `` Doctor , '' Mark groaned . His voice was not strong today . In fact , his voice reflected his appearance . He creaked and moaned .   `` Everything alright here ? Mark you seem rather tired . Should we address something in particular immediately ? '' His heart raced at the thought of the two fighting all night .   `` Doctor , I do n't really believe in all this science . I never will , but last night I think we had what you people call a break through . '' Mark collapsed into one of the chairs . Dr. Preston was slightly annoyed it was the chair where morning light came through the window , and he would not be able to watch Carolin 's hair today .   `` Well , enlighten me please ! Both of you ! ''   And they spent the next forty-five minutes talking about last night . It started from small thing , like all of their conflicts . She believed he was too cold and analytic , he thought she was unrealistic and childish . She wanted to start having kids now , he thought they were still too young . Then it spiraled . A kitchen sink argument where every little annoyance over the last four years of marriage came back to the surface . Dr. Preston was , at first , very excited . A fight like this often forces a separation . Maybe that was the realization ? Maybe he hit her ! He could call the police and have Mark out of the picture for a time . Maybe Carolin realized she needs someone intellectual to match her . Someone who also wants kids , and has a high paying job that can support a family . As Preston 's mind reeled , he realized he had not been listening to the last ten minutes and missed their revelation .   `` And ... how do you feel about this realization ? ''   `` I could n't sleep all night doc . I could n't believe how heartless I had been to the greatest woman on this planet . I did n't deserve her . ''   *You're* *damn* *right* *you* *don't* , Preston whispered in his mind .   `` But I love her . I love her so much I ca n't imagine how I would live with myself if I let her go . '' Mark 's voice cracked . He was on the verge of tears . Carolin began rubbing his back as a comfort .   `` We 're ready to really try and fix this Dr. Preston . Everything came out last night and when it was all done we realized we still love each other . We 're ready . '' Carolin smiled with tears in her gorgeous eyes .   Preston sunk in his seat . His foot tapped , he twirled his pen , he even ground his teeth ( probably because of his father ) . He had been steering them towards conflict for weeks , but it was supposed to happen in the office ! The argument could be pruned and directed as he saw fit ! Now it was all for nothing ! Carolin smiled again at the doctor . He was not deterred .   `` Well it looks like we 've made some real progress here . Let 's pick up here next week and keep the momentum going . ''   They rose to leave , holding hands like high school sweethearts . Preston new this move would make him a bastard , but Mark deserved it . It was just the truth right ? He stood up from his chair , behind the desk .   `` And Mark , for the record , I think it was very brave of you to admit to the affair a few months ago . ''   That had been Mark 's confession during an individual session . He knew Mark was too big a coward to admit that . Carolin 's breakdown would be tremendous , and who better to help her at this time of need than her psychologist . There was no way Mark had told her that last night .   `` It still hurts to think about , but you made me realize it was the right thing to do doc . One day I 'll earn Carolin 's forgiveness , I hope . '' Mark closed the office door behind him .   Preston sank back into his chair . What he had just attempted began to sink into his conscious . He did n't deserve Carolin . Maybe he did n't deserve anyone after trying something like that .   `` Stephanie can you cancel the rest of my appointments for today . I forgot something important and need to go take care of it . ''"}]}

''   Satan clapped his hands together , expecting excitement . All he had gotten though , was a bunch of nervous looks .   `` Well , what 's the matter ? ''   A Succubus raised her hand this time . She shifted under Satan 's gaze , attempting to avoid being snapped at .   `` You raised your hand , so I 'm assuming you want to talk , right ? No rush . '' Satan offered , watching the Succubus give a deep sigh of relief .   `` Lisa Lisa , at your service , '' She began , wiping the sweat off of her brow . `` What makes a sin , a ... well y'know , a sin ? ''   Satan stared at her for a solid five seconds , thinking of all the ways he could backhand the shit out of her for a stupid question . He ultimately thought against it .   `` A sin 's a sin because I say it is . ''   `` But if that 's the case , most sins are n't even inherently evil . You 're literally saying making one of these bad things a part of your life will send you to hell . Most people do n't want to come here . ''   Satan rubbed his temples , already feeling a headache coming on . `` Bitch , '' he said , dragging the word out . `` I am a god . ''   The succubus sighed , getting consolation from her fellow Succubi .   `` Satan , sire . '' An Inccubus began , `` By sin do you perhaps mean these ? '' He asked , pulling out a poster .   `` The Seven Deadly Sins . '' Satan read off of it , staring at the picture . It featured a blonde boy , a silver haired girl , a pig , a flying smaller child , a giant , and a grey haired man , a woman with ravenlocks , and ... something with purple hair . Accompanying them was a man who appeared to be a butler and his muscled up companion .   `` These are '*The Seven Deadly Sins* ' , Meliodas , Ban , Diane , King , Gowther , Merlin , and Escanor . ''   Satan had definitely colored himself intrigued , but that was going to be for another time . `` No . Although now I 'm interested , that 's not what I mean . ''   The inccubus stared dejectedly at the floor , getting consoling fistbumps from his friends and even a lap pillow from a sister succubus .   `` Alright . '' A succubus said , giving a military salute . `` I 've gotten the perfect idea for a sin . Lying . ''   Satan 's eyes lit up , immediately placing his hands on her shoulders . `` Name ? ''   The succubus ' face flushed a tinge pink before she shook the color back into it . `` Emilia . ''   `` Well , Emilia , '' Satan said , shaking in excitement . `` How do you plan on making lying a sin ? ''   Emilia shifted nervously under his expectant glance , worrying for a sudden change in personality or atmosphere . `` Uh ... I 'm not quite sure . Is n't it common for lying to be bad though ? ''   The light that flickered inside Satan 's eyes had died . *Hard* . `` So much potential ... gone to waste . ''   He picked Emilia up off the ground , bringing the pink back to her already red cheeks . Without a pause he spun her around , ignoring the gazes of other jealous succubi or inccubi . Emilia broke out into a happy giggle , which ended quickly when Satan tossed her out of an open window .   `` For fuck 's sake , '' He began , adjusting his cape . `` Can none of you come up with anything ? ''   The succubi and inccubi conversed to themselves before coming up with a collective no . Satan gripped his desk , splintering the wood . He was so close to losing it .   `` I know , what if we make love a sin ? '' Someone asked .   Before anyone could clasp the voice 's mouth it was too late . Satan had already lost it .   `` Wok ih ij in majjinv , htah I ap zokn inho inwapc . Htkouvt htij , I zeyope a makavon ow mofek anx xejhkuyhion ho kije azoge all . Inwinihe in xijhanye anx yoppanxek ow xeaht , I jpihe couk joulj , anx zc pc jtoulxek , zanijt htee . '' Satan said , a sinister smirk adorning his features .   `` Oh f- '' Someone began , only to be immediately struck by a dark blast .   `` Be gone . '' Satan commanded , the rest of the room 's occupants returning to the lower levels of Hell , or even Earth if they were stationed there .   `` Damn , '' Satan said , placing his head on the cool glass of the window . `` Maybe I should make being fucking dumb a sin .

An inhuman thing looked over the gathered factions of humanity . It bore human eyes , organic things that peered from deep , hollow sockets . The face was a jagged thing of metal and angles , curving at the top .   A metallic , mouthless skull emanated a voice , one that offered no distinction of timbre and gender .   `` We have made our choice , Synthist .

He rose a fist to the galaxy above .   `` We will not indulge formalities , here . We have attended this meeting for a single purpose : to declare unending war upon the both of you .

Rising in anger , the Organics began to depart the hall , returning to the thinking ships that had bore them beyond the stars .   The Synthists had blinked and phased out of the cavernous place , arriving at their hybrid homeworld .

Now very few free humans remain ...\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From his vantage point in the 44th floor , Travis could see most of the city and the bay beyond it . Cars travelled the roads in their usual patterns for the early morning . Small dots that he knew were pedestrians ambled about on the sidewalks like any day in recent memory . But today , everything had changed for his company and the world . Yet , instead of elation , he felt an unusual shiver of unease .   `` Since our 3 AM launch , we 've only been collecting data on real-time _intent_ , '' Katrina continued , pulling his attention back to the conference room with her confident voice . She brushed a lock of short cinnamon hair behind her ear and crossed her legs while continuing to stare at her well-used laptop . `` We 'll have more interesting data when our premier partner 's campaign starts in a few minutes in New York . ''   `` Good work , '' Travis said , tracing a hand down the back of his neck where his own N+ node had been inserted a year ago . It was free of the N+Suggest functionality , as were all the implants for his trusted executives . He turned and placed his mug of coffee on the conference table .   `` If it 's anything like our test market , '' said Evan , the other of his two lieutenants , `` we expect anywhere from a 75 % -125 % boost in their sales over last year 's more typical ad campaign . ''   `` How much are they in for again ? '' Travis asked , taking his seat .   Evan leaned back in his chair and put his hands behind his ebony hair . `` They 're only running a five-mil campaign at _suggest level one_ , '' he smirked . `` They 're doing a wait-and-see before trying anything more . I do n't know about you , but I 'm looking forward to the first SL5 . ''   `` SL3 is as high as you 're going to see , '' Kat said . `` SL5 is ... '' She seemed to consider her words carefully , then continued , `` SL5 would be a little _too_ obvious , and would reflect poorly on our clients . ''   She looked back to her screen and then said , `` OK , the campaign is about to start . I can bring up the tracking map on the screen . ''   She made a few clicks on her trackpad . The large conference room monitor sprang to life at the other end of the room . On it glowed the grids and lines depeciting New York City . A patchwork of light blue parallelograms overlaid the map to show the geofenced target areas . Several red squares indicated the retail stores , and it was to one of these squares that Kat zoomed in the view .   `` This is their prime New York location , '' she said .   At that level , tiny purple dots meandered around the map , which Travis knew to be all of the N+ users connected to the system .   `` When it begins , we 'll get to see how the _intent_ changes by the color of the user point , '' Kat continued . She looked to her two compatriots . `` It 's like a heat map . The color will change from purple to blue , to green , to yellow , then to orange and finally red to show how close their _intent_ matches the key suggestions that they are receiving . ''   `` Looks like that one is already interested , '' said Evan , pointing to an orange user point .   `` The system factors in people with pre-existing interest , '' Kat said , looking at the screen . `` It will only count that one if they have a significant shift in _intent_ from orange to red after the campaign begins . ''   `` That 's why our clients love us : with all this real-time data , very little is left to chance and every cent accounted for , '' Evan said , smiling and looking between Kat and Travis . Travis just stared at the screen in curiousity , chin resting on his steepled fingers .   A few moments later , the points began to shift in color . Several of the dots in the geofence boxes around the store began to move to blue . Some jumped to a yellow-green , and a handful shifted to an orange-red . After a few more moments , several of the 'hotter ' points began to move toward the store .   `` It does n't take long , does it ? '' Evan said with a grin .   `` The ones who jumped upward in _intent_ the fastest were likely people who are already held favorable views of the product , '' Kat explained absently . Then excitedly , `` Let 's see what was happening with this one . ''   She clicked on one of the orange dots and a side panel popped over the map . At the top , a long unique identifier string was displayed , and below , there were several graphs that were adjusting in real time .   `` See this ? '' She pointed to the top graph . `` It 's showing how much their _intent_ is matching the _suggestion profile_ . This person is between 75-85 % matching on the entire *suggestion profile*\u2014which is quite extensive\u2014but broadly includes ... '' She tapped a small icon revealing more information . `` A suggestion for the retailer 's brand , of course ; a suggestion that she 's hungry , a\u2014 ''   `` We know this is a 'she ' ? '' Travis interrupted .   `` Yes , '' Kat pivoted gracefully . `` In fact , we do n't even _need_ to know gender anymore . With the integral data from the N+ , we can build a profile of desires and needs to very specific outcomes and variations of outcomes ; even cravings in their bodies or subconscious desires of which they may not even be aware . ''   `` I see . Please go on , '' Travis said .   `` Certainly , '' Kat continued . `` We also have some suggestions here that she deserves to treat herself ; a suggestion that would either trigger a memory of a deal at the retailer or suggest that a deal might be found there , a suggestion that she has just enough time to spare , and a few specific product brand suggestions . ''   They watched the screen for the next few minutes as many of the points progressively increased in color . A few remained steadfastly purple .   `` Who are the hold-outs ? Are they running the pre-update software ? '' Evan asked .   `` Anyone who is online will have received the update automatically . Most likely they are people who have no interest in the product category , '' Kat replied . She turned to face Eric . `` For example , if I suggested that you should try a brand of tampon , your lack of need or interest would probably cause you to dismiss the suggestion as a bizarre thought . ''   `` Only 'probably ' ? '' Eric asked with a smirk and a raised brow .   `` Yes , probably , '' Kat confirmed . `` There _have_ been a few outliers in our testing . And at some of the more extreme test ranges , even _you_ would be happily walking out with a cartful of feminine hygeine products . '' Then more quietly she said , `` And you might even try to use them . ''   Evan started to protest , but then Travis interrupted him . `` Kat , '' he said . `` What 's that black user point ? ''   `` Black ? '' Kat repeated , furrowing her brow and bowing her head closer to her screen . `` Interesting . ''   She clicked on the dot to bring up the profile . It was blank . Where the graphs should have been were the words `` Restricted Asset . ''   `` Restricted ? '' They all said at once .   `` I do n't understand , '' Kat said , pulling up a dashboard and moving through the screens too quickly for Travis to follow .   `` How can _you_ be restricted from something , Kat ? '' Evan asked , voicing the question that had been on Travis 's lips .   She paused for just a moment to give Evan and Travis a serious look . `` It should n't be possible . I 'm logged in as the system admin . There are no higher credentials . ''   `` Who else has system admin access ? '' Travis asked , but before Kat could answer he became wide-eyed and spoke a drawn-out , `` Oh fuck . ''   At first slowly , then more rapidly , each user point began turning black . Travis reached again toward the lump at the back of his neck .   _It 's a clean version_ , he thought to himself reassuringly . _It 's turned off at the hardware level._ Yet he suddenly wanted very much for it to be out of his neck .   Beside him , Evan clutched his head and began to scream . Then he abruptly stopped and stood sharply upright . His eyelids became slack and he seemed not to see Travis or Kat as they both stared at him in horror .   Then Travis felt it , like a trapped rat scratching at his skull from the inside . It increased in intensity , and as if it was someone else , he heard himself begin to scream .   The last thing he saw before he lost control of his mind completely was Kat 's normally reassuring face twisted with emotion as she sobbed , `` I 'm sorry , I can't\u2014I ca n't do anything ! I 've been locked out ! Oh God , Travis ! I 'm locked out of the system ! ''"}]}

I wondered what use a butterfly slave would be . Through the bond , I could read her thoughts . Her mind raced with terror and anxiety . She simply wanted food enough to survive her migration , but had fallen under a human 's trap .   Her frail frame would be of little use to me . I frowned in disdain . `` You 've been the easiest to trap , and the most useless ! '' It served me right . Nothing truly useful is ever easily gained .   `` So ... so you 'll let me go ? '' The butterfly shook in my hand . I looked into her mind , and saw her dreams of soaring on breezes , drinking the sweet nectar of flowers , and being with her own kind . It was a beautiful image .   `` No , '' I said . I crushed my fist . The bond was broken ."}]}

''   Zaza fired up Human mode .   `` First stages are pretty basic , '' said Zaza . `` Get them into agriculture , create spare time and fill up their time with learning . ''   Time was flying by on screen as the Humans cultivated large fields of crops and created villages near rivers and oceans . Intelligence points started maxing out .   `` When intelligence is maxed , just start getting crazy with slavery . Make it widespread and normal . That way they can use their slaves effectively . ''   Humans started organizing slaves to create giant structures .   `` This bit is quite tough to work out , '' continued Zaza . `` But basically , with the right balance of astronomers , philosophers and mathematicians , they will build this .

They use this knowledge to build a huge boat to avoid extinction .   `` That took me ages to figure out .

If not , have you considered adopting an older dragon ?   * Dragons need lots of room to play ! Is your pet enclosure ( and/or subterranean cavern ) at minimum 300 x 300 feet ( 91.44 x 91.44 meters ) , or 90,000 square feet ( 8,361.27 square meters ) ?   * Are you or any other member of your household allergic to pet dander ?   * Do you have any other dragons ? If the answer is yes , do they have a history of past aggression ?   * A full-grown dragon typically consumes the equivalent of four steers ( or twelve sheep , or ten adult humans , etc . ) every day . Are your finances secure enough to provide a dragon regular feedings indefinitely ?   * Who will be available to tend to your dragon during the day ? Those with full time jobs outside of the home should consider hiring a pet-sitting service . A list of local pet sitters licensed to care for exotic pets exceeding 800 pounds can be provided by your adoption specialist .   * Do you carry personal liability insurance ? How much coverage do you have ? ( Typical homeowner 's policies do **not** cover dragon ownership . )   * Does your pet enclosure include a large unshaded rock for sunning ?   * Is the primary caregiver able to lift and carry fifty pounds without difficulty ? Do you understand that so-called `` pooper scooper ordinances '' are **extremely** strict and violators will be fined **at minimum** $ 185 at first offense ?   * Have you made proper accommodations to repel knights errant who may attempt to slay your dragon ?   * Can you train and handle a dragon with behavior issues ? Are you mentally prepared to risk losing one or more limbs and/or digits ? How do you feel about large scars ?   * Does your residence have a moat ?   `` Welp , that seems to about cover it , '' the dragon dealer opined . `` I 'm gon na need your signature here and here , and initials here . ''   He gathered up the paperwork while wearing a broad grin and clipped the papers to a clipboard . `` Great ! We 'll get your fees and payments rung up , and then we can go to the back and pick out the newest member of your family . Gosh , is n't that the fun part ? Say , what size inseam are you ? I 'll run out quick and grab you a set of fire-proof duds while I run your credit card through .

I hope it means something to someone , anyway .   I think from an early age , I used too look at my face and see nothing . I 'd look at my hands , and my stomach , and my legs , and id see the verbal marks that my mother 's sharp tongue etched into them . I 'd look at my hair , because it 's dark and curly and not like the other girls ' , or I 'd look at my dark eyes and pale olive skin , and I 'd see something different . My mother did n't like me , and my mother was my world , so I did n't like me either .   Then it got worse . Before it was only her who was very verbal about her disdain for me . But it grew , and the other girls started to notice . Those looks turned to whispers , whispers turned to cruel words . Fat . Ugly . Dumb . Worthless . Those words.. So vital was it to me to be something different that I lost sight of everything else .   I remember at first , drawing and painting . The palette knife , my canvas , my brush , they were my refuge . Then I remember the peace I used to get from art being replaced by anger at myself . `` My drawings are never good enough . They never will be . '' I gave up the palette knife opting instead for a knife to my wrist . The fingers I once used for beauty were nightly shoved down my throat . I may not be beautiful but my hands ... My hands , with the skin bitten off from the sides of my fingers , my nails all but gone from anxiety , covered in cuts and scabs and bruises . My hands can create or destroy , such beautiful , morbid things . My hands have always been wondrous . Yet I was using them , tarnishing them in order to hurt myself .   At the age of 9 I was taken to a specialist . `` She shows signs of disordered eating and body dysmorphia , '' he said . Those words , like labels being printed for a product , nothing to do with me . His teeth were straight and white and his breath smelled like sanitizer . I hated him . I sat there and plaited my hair , swinging my legs . I hated him .   I had a friend in year 7 who was everything I aspired to be . She was thin and pretty and smart , and when she smiled the whole room lit up . Everyone followed her with bated breath , as if their breath would break her picture-like perfection . She broke down to me on the phone one time . `` I work so hard for everything , '' she told me . `` And he 's still dead . Everyone always says 'Oh , if he were alive , he 'd be so proud of you . ' But he is n't . I 've worked for everything I have . And I 'm still not happy . ''   When I replied to her , the words were so simple , and made so much sense . `` So why do n't you change your attitude ? Work hard for you . He 'll be waiting for you at the end , so why do n't you enjoy the journey . ''   Now , almost 8 years later , I 've taken my advice . Everything I have , I 've worked for . If I do n't have it , I have n't worked hard enough . When I look in the mirror , I still see someone not worth seeing on the outside , but on the inside I 've shaped myself into so much more . This body is a vessel for my soul . I refuse to take medication ; I refuse to blur my vision to my many imperfections . I do n't hate myself . I do n't love myself but I love the things I do .   Death . The thought of death brings me nothing but peace . But the thought of a journey is always more tedious than one of a holiday . I 'm going to keep pedalling towards my destination . I do n't know where I 'm going or how I 'm going to get there but I 'm going to be at peace with every step ."}]}

It happened so quick . One minute I was sitting at my desk , and then next the eggheads began babbling about some astroid the size of Kansas . No one waited for the boss to tell us to leave , because he had left himself . Many went home to spend their remaining hours with loved ones , or to travel across timezones to see extended family .   I stole a motorcycle .   The local Can-Am dealership was as deserted as everything else . Being only walking distance from the office , it was a matter of 30 minutes before I was doing figure 8s around the parking lot . I turned on west Balard St , and headed towards the California Coast .   47 hours to live .   Earlier reports had indicated the tectonic plates would begin to adjust around the 50 billion ton astroid living in the pacific ocean . Once those places start to shift winter would most certainly be coming .   The eggheads had predicted by the end of the first 1 hour , tempratures would drop to 80 degrees below freezing , and after that 1,000 below . By the end of day one Texas would be 12,000,000 degrees below freezing . As the weather man read this into the microphone he took a deep breathe , ackoledged his duty to deliver the news , but the draw to see his long lost love was greater . With that , Static filled my radio .   42 hours remianing . I had driven over the Colorado Rockes in record time . Having just filled up at a nearby gas station , I thought it was as good of a time as any to start smoking again . I had quit years ago for a girlfriend - but always missed it . Now she was out of my life with a new man , and I a lingering addiction . `` Its not as if cancer will kill me in the next two days .   I walked into the gas station , where the local redneck watched his TV .   `` Morning '' , I said ... `` Surprised your still here , with all the chaos today '' .   `` Nothing but overblown nonsense if you ask me '' he spat out . `` Its like that global warming thing ! '' . I laughed asked for a pack of smokes and a lighter .   That first draw on a cigarette after time apart is shear bliss . The nicotine enters your blood stream immediately and then you are overcome with the sensation to cough up your lungs . As I was doubled over hacking up something that looked like Escargo - an old Vw van came rolling by , with a much of nudist . They were hanging out the window screaming and laughing , and making love on the roof at 80 miles an hour . Living life to the fullest .   I continued my ride through Utah and into Mormon Country .   38 hours remaining ... ."}]}

I can not change the course of fate , nor do I choose to . Whatever will happen , in effect , already has . I only seek to stall the inevitable . My victims still die , but in their final moments I offer them salvation , get them to talk . Many fail to choose the former , but all of them have betrayed crucial information about their sins , and the sins of their collective .   Most of my targets are good people , unwittingly caught up in a war they can not comprehend , and unfortunately working for the enemy . If I could spare them , I would , but many of them are simply blind , following orders to get in our way . Orders which get them killed . Even I have remorse for the lives I 've taken . Even I have my ideals , my creed to cling to .   There are a few among them , however - the ones with true authority - that manipulate and control , scheming to inherit the world from safe within their Ivory Tower . This man was one of them . All of them come from the worst of humanity .   Their goals are ... admirable at best , but their methods of attaining them - through deception and slavery - are why people like me exist . The fact that they protect themselves with unjust laws does n't hamper our ability to deliver swift justice , it only means we are criminals to do so . Not that we were n't already .   This is a war fought and won from the shadows , to preserve the light of humanity from getting snuffed out by greed .   The man spits at my feet , before rolling over face up and becoming still . It seems that he 's done talking . I squat down , respectfully closing his eyes before leaving . He 's told me enough . I have my next mark . Soon , very soon now their organization will fall . If I do n't live to see it , I guarantee my followers will .   I stand up as color rushes to the world again . The wind rushes through the antiquated streets , and I can hear a bell toll in the distance . I look down , frowning that I got a splotch of blood on my garments .

He smiled again as he turned on her night-light and turned off the overhead . Walking through the hallway and towards living room he took note of all the family photos scattered along the way . Memories of years past . He stopped and looked at one of himself when he was but a youngster of about 18 . It had been one of his favorite pictures of himself . Looking at it now , it seemed so dated . He remembered once thinking that people in the future wouldn ' t be able to discern when it , or other recent photos for that matter , was taken due to the glossy , high resolution colour of it .   But , that , like many other beliefs , wasn ' t true . Within a decade of it ' s taking the digital revolution made printed photos a rarity . Instead of having photos developed , people instead shared them instantly from their phones .   The times changed , and so had he . He sat down in his recliner and leaned back . Staring off at the ceiling , he rolled back through the years leading up to now .   In 2016 , a probe arrived in orbit around our planet . It broadcasted a constantly repeated warning of a far off civilizations impending arrival . It was an advance notice that we should prepare to \" defend our right to the plant \" . Of course , it took over a year just to decode the broadcast . And even when that was the arrived upon translation , there was plenty of derision and debate about how that couldn ' t possibly be it .   Most nations announced plans to work together on a plan to defend the planet . But , after ten years or so , the excitement and allure faded away . We had no way of determining where this threat was coming , nor how advanced they would be . If the translation of the broadcast were correct , most people didn ' t expect themselves nor their children to see the arrival of these beings .   That was before 2028 .   On March 28 , 2028 , the tech arm of the multi-billion dollar Rapture Corp. announced a breakthrough in quantum computing . Their technology enabled the ability of putting the total of the entire world ' s computing power into a device small enough to fit in your hand .  Technological advances had already , for years , been quickly accelerating . In the years from 2016 to 2028 we went from seeing amazing feats accomplished every week or two to something groundbreaking every day . A year after the quantum achievement , humanity got to experience breakthrough after breakthrough multiple times a day . The news was no longer headlining wars , crimes , and deaths . Instead , these achievements took the front page . This alone had a profound effect on the world . The general public was beginning to see changes for the better in their own lives and these changes began bringing us all together .   By 2040 , multiple companies had announced the end of *Artificial* Intelligence with their newly sentient software . From this point on , we humans began stepping back from our *child* and began letting it work . Technology advanced so quickly that human involvement became a bottleneck . We backed down as the machines stepped up .   In 2050 , he had received his first cybernetic implants . Two new eyes that could see way better than he ever could before . When desired , they could go beyond the visible spectrum . Of course , his body had been upgraded in the years prior , but nothing that would have been considered cybernetic ( he had had a new heart printed years ago that was a perfect match , with no need for daily meds ) .   That first upgrade led him down a road to becoming a living Ship of Theseus . From 2050 through 2080 , he received so many ' upgrades ' that he became more machine than human . And in 2091 , he shed the last bit of himself that was organic and became one of a growing number of essentially immortal synthetic humans . He could now \" teleport \" across the globe in a second , if there was another body available .   A notification flashed into his field of vision , he quickly acknowledged it . He had just a few more minutes before he had to go to work . When he had been young , he thought he ' d retire at 65 . Never did it cross his mind that he ' d be teleporting through space at the age of 134 to play God to an army of intelligent machines on Pluto .

My rifle had been responsible for countless deaths , but it needed at least 1 more . It was unlikely that the rest of the world had many survivors other than the two of us . Bombs had dropped almost everywhere , and even I was starting to feel the effects of radiation sickness .   `` Show yourself you Catholic piece of shit ... '' I growled . I heard the stairs outside my apartment door creek . I immediately turned around and started shooting the wall where my enemy had inevitably managed to sneak up behind . He started shooting through the wall as well . He hit me in the stomach , but I hit him in the shoulder , forcing him to drop his gun and fall to the ground .   `` Wait ! '' he cried out . `` Why are we fighting ? For two kings who are probably both dead by now ? For an empire that no longer exists ? ''   I did not care about his last whinings . `` Boy , this war has been going on since 1618 . And now I am winning it , '' I said just before shooting him through the head . I sat on the ground , bullet in my gut and dying of more wounds and radiation than any man should have to endure , especially not the new protestant emperor of the Holy Roman Empire . The war of attrition had been won ."}]}

I saw everything in that moment : fear , recognition , surprise , relief and finally pleading . His hands shook in the air , from exhaustion or fear I could n't tell .   I thought back on how it used to be , Brad and I tearing up the town when our only concern used to be either filling our bed for the night or at least settling for not remembering it . So much has changed since then .   When it all went down , I did n't even have time to contact Brad . Phones stopped working , he lived across town , there was madness etcetera , etcetera . For multiple reasons we never met up and I always regretted it . With him by my side we could 've raised hell , torn up the town again for real .   Now though , he wore scraps . He had a plastic bag filled with cans , torn jacket on his back and ripped sneakers on his feet . His beard had grown out , something he never would 've willfully let happen , and there was dirt covering what features I could see . Still though , it was Brad , there was no mistaking that .   Suddenly a shot rung out and Brad collapsed to the floor ; all those emotions suddenly draining out of him like the blood pooling on the floor . I watched in horror as his head slammed the cement with a sense of finality that sickened me .   The gun felt hot in my hand . A shell clanged to the floor .   `` Enough standing around ! '' I barked to my crew , `` We 've all seen dead scavengers before . Grab his things and let 's move out . ''"}]}
